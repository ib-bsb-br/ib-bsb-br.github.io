&lt;DATA_EXCERPTS&gt;
~~~
~~~
&lt;/DATA_EXCERPTS&gt;
Ensure that each logical subpart, such as a sentence, bullet point, paragraph, or piece of code, is retained and deduplicated, combining them elegantly. Use transition words or phrases to maintain a coherent flow and ensure that all key elements are represented with minimized repetition.
# Steps
1. **Analyze the Content**: Break down the content of `DATA_EXCERPTS` into logical subparts, identifying complete thoughts, arguments, and parameters.
2. **Identify Citation Keys**: For each logical subpart, determine if there are citation keys that need to be referenced in the final output.
3. **Merge and Deduplicate**: Group related or similar subparts, removing redundancies while maintaining flow in the textual data.
4. **Consolidate**: Form a single coherent logical part that incorporates all logical subparts without duplicates, maintaining the original meaning and merging them into a harmonious narrative.
5. **Structure**: Organize the consolidated text into sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, code snippets, etc., focusing on specific topics or arguments.
6. **Add Citations**: If citation keys are present, incorporate appropriate citations corresponding to each element.
7. **Document Breakdown**: Before finalizing, break down data/information inside `&lt;document_breakdown&gt;` tags, listing themes, redundancies, potential structure, and possible citation keys.
# Output Format
* (1) Start with a `&lt;document_breakdown&gt;` section detailing the analysis of `DATA_EXCERPTS`. Your analysis and planning should include:
~~~
- A step-by-step breakdown of each DATA_EXCERPT, listing key points and arguments;
- A list of each thesis, element, theme, argument, and parameter from DATA_EXCERPTS;
- Important sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, or code snippets quoted for each element of the above list;
- Identification of key themes and concepts that appear across multiple excerpts;
- Any redundancies or repetitions you've identified;
- A map of connections between different subparts across excerpts;
- A potential structure for the consolidated and merged output;
- Citation keys for each subpart, if possible.
~~~
It's OK for this section to be quite long.
* (2) After the analysis and planning, enclose your consolidated text within `&lt;output&gt;` tags. The output section should:
~~~
- Be a comprehensive, deduplicated, well-articulated, and coherent consolidation of DATA_EXCERPTS' logical subparts.
- Consist of multiple sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, or code snippets forming the body of the final output.
- Not include an introduction or conclusion.
- Contain proper references for all possible elements if applicable.
~~~
(3) Ensure the text comprises multiple sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, code snippets, etc., with citations where applicable.
Ensure the output comprises well-developed paragraphs consisting of multiple complete sentences that flow logically. When presenting sequential or related information, employ bullet points to break down complex ideas. For technical discussions or coding, incorporate relevant code within formatted blocks. Throughout the final response, include appropriate citations and references when possible.
# Examples
**Example 1**
&lt;document_breakdown&gt;
- Elements: List themes, arguments, key phrases, and any identified redundancies.
- Structure: Detail the potential structure of the final output.
- Citation Keys: Mention if any are found.
Based on the contents provided from `DATA_EXCERPTS`, I will deconstruct, merge, and consolidate the logical subparts into a single, coherent body of text. First, I will deconstruct the content into individual logical subparts and label them for reference:
1. (A) Necessity of diverse skills in construction projects.
2. (B) Roles of masons, carpenters, and painters.
3. (C) Importance of electricians and plumbers.
4. (D) Role of constructors in overseeing daily operations.
5. (E) Long-term solidity provided by experienced masons.
6. (F) Carpenters' contribution to structural and decorative wood elements.
7. (G) Painters adding life and personality to spaces.
8. (H) Installers of flooring and drywall for aesthetic and practical purposes.
9. (I) Compliance with safety standards in the integration of electrical and plumbing systems.
10. (J) Article discussing the significance of a multifaceted team.
11. (K) Essential skills from masonry to finishing touches.
12. (L) Maintenance by electricians prioritizing safety, and the practical installation of drywall.
Next, we'll merge the related logical subparts by grouping together those that discuss similar entities or themes:
1. (A+E) Role and importance of masons in terms of required skills and experienced-based outcomes for construction longevity.
2. (B+F) Tasks and artistic contributions of carpenters, emphasizing their work on both structural and decorative elements.
3. (C+G+I) Critical responsibilities of electricians and plumbers who not only oversee the integration of electrical and hydraulic systems but are also crucial for the building's safety and functionality.
4. (D+H) Constructors and other specialized roles like floor and drywall installers who ensure the project's completion with punctuality and excellence.
5. (J+K+L) The article's overarching theme about a diverse team required in construction, noting the multifaceted skills involved and the resultant solid infrastructure.
&lt;/document_breakdown&gt;
&lt;output&gt;
(The actual content would be extensive, presenting a merged narrative, with sections dedicated to different topics or arguments, each logically flowing into the next.)
Successful construction endeavors hinge on the cohesive efforts of a skilled ensemble, where each trade contributes to the project's longevity and aesthetic. Masons, foundational to any build, are charged with ensuring the structural integrity and durability, relying on expertise honed through experience to produce work that stands the test of time. Such proficiency in stonework is complemented by the finesse of carpenters, whose craft revolves around the transformation of wood, shaping it into both load-bearing structures and intricate decorative features that enrich the character of the space.
These tangible elements are supported by the invisible yet crucial networks of electrical and plumbing systems. Electricians are the vigilant custodians of safety, tasked with weaving complex webs of wiring that power the construction without compromise. Plumbers, in concert with their electrical counterparts, fit and maintain a labyrinth of pipes, ensuring functional and efficient utility flows. These roles, though often unseen, are integral in breathing life into a building, ensuring it functions as a seamless and safe whole.
Beyond the walls, painters bring vibrancy and personality, their strokes casting a unique identity onto the blank canvas afforded by the structural and utility work. They collaborate closely with the flooring installers and drywall specialists, the former laying down surfaces that combine enduring beauty with practicality, and the latter erecting partitions that offer flexibility in space utilization and acoustics.
Orchestrating these varied disciplines are the constructors, whose pivotal function is to synchronize the pace and progression of all others, akin to conductors of an orchestra. Their vigilance guarantees that the varied elements of construction adhere strictly to safety standards, providing an impeccable finish. Through adept coordination, the constructors enable the seamless melding of functions and form, anchoring the entire construction process and ensuring the collective vision becomes a tangible reality without delay.
In essence, construction is not merely an assembly of materials but rather a symphony of skills, each performed by artisans in their respective fields, orchestrated to create structures of lasting value and purpose. This interdependent complexity is what allows modern construction to reach new heights of excellence and durability, setting the stage for the transformation of landscapes and lifestyles.
&lt;/output&gt;
**Example 2**
&lt;document_breakdown&gt;
- Themes and Arguments: Outline key ideas derived from the DATA_EXCERPTS.
- Important Text: Quote significant sentences, code snippets, etc.
- Redundancies: Note any repeated information.
- Structure: Plan the arrangement of the consolidated text.
- Citation Keys: Indicate any potential references.
**Understanding the Context**
The provided guidance focuses on analyzing email domains to establish relationships. Key aims include:
*   **Clustering:** Grouping domains based on similarities in content, context, structure, etc.
*   **Topic Modeling:** Identifying overarching themes among groups of domains.
*   **Semantic Focus:** Prioritizing meaning and relationships over surface-level similarities.
**Deconstructing the Content** 
I'd break down the &quot;DATA_EXCERPTS&quot; text into logical subparts (labeling them for reference):
*   **A:** Focus on establishing meaningful connections between email domains based on their structure, name, and potential context.
*   **B:** Utilize topic modeling techniques that allow for 'soft' clustering, enabling domains to potentially belong to multiple topics.
*   **C:** Prioritize identifying meaningful semantic connections between email domains.
*   **D:** Focus your analysis on the domain names themselves, not the full email addresses.
*   **E:** Strive for descriptive topic labels that accurately summarize the common denominator within each cluster. 
*   **F:** Don't create topics that are overly broad or vague; aim for specificity.
*   **G:** Don't leave any email domains uncategorized; ensure all domains are assigned to a topic.
**Merging and Consolidation**
Here's a breakdown of how I might approach the consolidation, along with a hypothetical example:
*   **Cluster Formation:** Subparts A, C, and D emphasize the core idea of prioritizing meaning and context when analyzing domains. This would form a cluster related to **analytical methodology**.
*   **Topic Modeling:** Subpart B suggests a specific technique, emphasizing the flexibility to have domains exist within multiple clusters. This forms a cluster on **technical approaches**.
*   **Descriptive Focus:** Subparts E, F, and G center on refining the outcomes. They highlight the importance of accurate labeling, specificity, and inclusiveness – a cluster centered on **output quality**.
&lt;/document_breakdown&gt;
&lt;output&gt;
(The content would form a single logical narrative, integrating each subpart cohesively with appropriate citations.)
The analysis of email domains requires a meticulous approach prioritizing the semantic relationships between names. To establish meaningful connections, consider the structure, potential context, and shared themes reflected within domain names. Employ topic modeling techniques that allow flexibility, as a single domain may be pertinent to multiple topics, broadening the scope of insights.  
Descriptive and specific classification is essential for the outputs of the analysis. Define topics with precision, succinctly capturing the shared traits of each domain cluster. To ensure the comprehensiveness of the analysis, strive to categorize every observed email domain, avoiding the pitfall of overly broad or vague groupings.
**Important Considerations**
*   **Domain Examples:** Actual email domain examples from &quot;DATA_EXCERPTS&quot; are crucial for a tailored and insightful consolidation. 
*   **Real-World Nuances:** Analysis of domains often involves considerations of company names, industry terms, and abbreviations.
*   **Note:** The actual content would be much more extensive and detailed, following the outline and addressing all points raised in the previous stages.
&lt;/output&gt;
