        "MyLifeOrganized has a lot of properties. Often, I see people using them without understanding their purpose or benefits. They just use whatever comes to hand. Hence my rule: Assign specific properties to certain types of tasks to quickly create a simple list of tasks, projects, and information with the necessary sorting. It’s essential to understand the purpose of each property:</p>\n

        "<p>By the way, there are properties I don’t use at all. But this is not due to ignorance of their purpose, but my conscious choice. I understand that for you, these might be some of the most important properties. To make it clearer, I’ll give an example of how I analyze properties. It’s enough to give each value a definition that leaves no room for ambiguous interpretation. For example, a deadline. What is it? A deadline is a point after which it either makes no sense to complete the task, or certain consequences occur after the given date or time (financial loss, letting someone down, damaging relationships, etc.). A deadline is assigned only to tasks that have one. To determine whether to assign a deadline to a task, ask: What will happen if I don’t complete this task by the assigned deadline? If nothing significant (in my understanding) happens, no deadline is assigned. These tasks can be important, urgent, “for yesterday,” “for the day before yesterday,” which will also affect their weight in the list of active actions. But they don’t have a real deadline. This approach helps avoid a large number of overdue tasks, especially those with low priority, which undoubtedly affects internal calm and trust in the system.</p>\n

        "Such tasks can be called areas of responsibility. Their main purpose is: What and how often should be done to keep life under control and prevent crises? This can also be called crisis prevention. Given that recurring tasks vary in type and priority, I pay great attention in my planning system to setting the correct duration for each task. This helps avoid overdue tasks and stay in a state of flow. The correct duration of a task is the stretch between the start date and the deadline. On the forum, I once explained this using the example of cleaning an apartment. In such a task:</p>\n
