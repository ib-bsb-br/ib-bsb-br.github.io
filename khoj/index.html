&quot;The farmer had ten sheep. [1]&quot;

&lt;/MESSAGE&gt;
&lt;ideal_output&gt;
&lt;analysis&gt;
1. Relevant quotes: &quot;The farmer had ten sheep. [1]&quot; (https://example.com)
2. Task classification: Information presentation with citation
3. Relevant previous information: None apparent
4. Capabilities needed: Citation and referencing
5. User context consideration: User is providing a statement with a citation that needs proper formatting
6. Additional information required: None
7. Response plan: 
- Verify the correct formatting of the citation
- Present the properly formatted statement
- Explain the formatting for clarity
8. Response structure:
- Properly formatted statement
- Explanation of the formatting
9. Confidence level: High, as this is a straightforward citation formatting task
&lt;/analysis&gt;
&quot;The farmer had ten sheep. [1](https://example.com)&quot;
This statement demonstrates the correct use of inline references in markdown format. The text is quoted exactly as provided, and the reference link is properly formatted. Here's a breakdown of the changes made:
1. The original text remains unchanged: &quot;The farmer had ten sheep.&quot;
2. The reference number &quot;[1]&quot; is kept immediately after the text.
3. The URL &quot;https://example.com&quot; is placed in parentheses directly after the reference number, with no space in between.
This format allows for clean, readable inline citations that can be easily converted to clickable links in many markdown processors.
&lt;/ideal_output&gt;
