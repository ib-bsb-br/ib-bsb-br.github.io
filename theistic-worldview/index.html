<p>The foundation of any worldview rests on its understanding of ultimate reality (ontology) and the nature of the Divine (theology proper). This section establishes the core metaphysical principles that underpin the entire system, moving from the existence of the cosmos to the character of its Creator.</p>
  <h4 id="1-the-uncaused-cause-and-the-foundation-of-existence">
    
    
     <a href="#1-the-uncaused-cause-and-the-foundation-of-existence">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top"><strong>1. The Uncaused Cause and the Foundation of Existence</strong></a>

<p>The very existence of the universe, with its observable order and laws, points logically toward a transcendent cause. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of reasoning, most notably the cosmological argument, which can be understood in two primary forms. The first is the temporal <em>Kalam cosmological argument</em>, which posits that everything that begins to exist has a cause; since the universe began to exist, it must have a cause.1 Evidence from modern cosmology strongly supports the premise of a finite beginning. The Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that entropy (disorder) in an isolated system always increases, implies that a universe existing for an infinite time would have already reached a state of maximum entropy, or “heat death,” which is contrary to our current state of disequilibrium. Furthermore, the observed expansion of the universe, when extrapolated backward, points to a singular origin point approximately 13.8 billion years ago.<br />
The second form is the argument from contingency, articulated by thinkers like Leibniz. This argument relies on the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which states that for any contingent fact, there must be an explanation of why it is the case.3 The universe as a whole is a “Big Conjunctive Contingent Fact”—it exists, but it could have been otherwise or not existed at all.3 The explanation for this ultimate contingent fact cannot be found<br />
<em>within</em> the series of other contingent things (e.g., explaining the universe by a multiverse simply pushes the question back: why does the multiverse exist?). The chain of explanations must terminate in a being whose existence is not contingent but <em>necessary</em>—a being that contains the reason for its own existence and is not caused by anything else.3 This necessary being is what we call God.<br />
He is not merely a “humanoid” projection but, as Aquinas argued, a being of pure actuality.4 This means God is fully realized, with no unfulfilled potential. In Aristotelian terms, “potentiality” is the capacity to be or to become something else, while “actuality” is the fulfillment of that capacity. A block of marble has the<br />
<em>potentiality</em> to become a statue; the finished statue is its <em>actuality</em>. God, as the First Cause, is pure act, having no potentiality, as there is nothing He could become that He is not already.4 From this, it follows that God is immutable (unchanging), as change is the movement from potentiality to actuality.4</p>

     <a href="#2-the-nature-of-goodness-and-divine-power">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top"><strong>2. The Nature of Goodness and Divine Power</strong></a>
        
    
  </h4>
      

<p>The original author’s assertion that “Might makes right” is a philosophically bankrupt and dangerous position. It aligns with the nihilistic claim of Thrasymachus in Plato’s <em>Republic</em> that “justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger” and has been rightly identified as the credo of totalitarian regimes. If this were true, morality would be entirely subjective and reducible to raw power, making terms like “goodness” and “justice” meaningless.5<br />
A coherent theism must vehemently reject this. Instead, God’s power (omnipotence) and His goodness (omnibenevolence) are intrinsically linked, but in a way that establishes an objective moral standard. The statement “Benevolence is Good Because it is what God always does” points toward Divine Command Theory, but to make this robust, we must ground it not in arbitrary will, but in God’s perfect and unchanging nature. Goodness is not an external standard that God follows; rather, God’s own character—perfectly rational, loving, and just—is the very definition and source of goodness. His commands, therefore, are not arbitrary fiats of raw power but are necessary expressions of His immutable nature. Power is the <em>capacity</em> to act, but His perfect moral character is what <em>directs</em> that action unfailingly toward the good. In this framework, God’s might does not <em>create</em> right; His might <em>serves</em> the right that is inherent to His own being.</p>

<p>This section addresses the human condition, seeking to reconcile the concepts of divine sovereignty and human freedom. It then provides a coherent explanation for the origin of evil within a world created by an all-good God.</p>
  <h4 id="1-divine-omniscience-and-human-free-will">
    
    
     <a href="#1-divine-omniscience-and-human-free-will">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top"><strong>1. Divine Omniscience and Human Free Will</strong></a>
        
    
  </h4>
      

<p>The idea that free will “degraded” God’s power is a misunderstanding of both concepts. A more sophisticated theological view, articulated by thinkers from Søren Kierkegaard to Alvin Plantinga, is that the creation of genuinely free beings is the <em>greatest</em> possible expression of divine omnipotence and goodness. A God who creates automatons demonstrates mere power, but a God who creates beings capable of freely choosing to love and enter into a relationship with Him demonstrates both power and love.7<br />
The apparent conflict between God’s omniscience and human freedom—the question of how our choices can be free if God already knows them—is elegantly resolved by understanding God’s relationship to time. As an eternal and immutable being, God exists outside of the linear flow of time that we experience.4 He does not have “foreknowledge” in the human sense of peering into a fixed future. Instead, as Aquinas explained, God experiences all of history—past, present, and future—in a single, simultaneous “now,” a concept described as “The simultaneously whole and perfect possession of interminable life.”4 He knows our choices not because He predetermined them, but because from His atemporal perspective, He sees us making them freely in our present moment, which is also His present moment. His knowledge does not cause our actions any more than a spectator’s knowledge of a recorded event causes that event to happen.9 This atemporal view preserves both God’s complete knowledge and humanity’s libertarian freedom without contradiction.</p>

     <a href="#2-the-nature-of-evil-and-the-fall">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top"><strong>2. The Nature of Evil and the Fall</strong></a>
        
    
  </h4>
      

<p>God did not create evil. Following the classical Augustinian tradition, evil is understood not as a substance or a created thing, but as a <em>privation</em> or <em>corruption</em> of the good.10 Just as darkness is merely the absence of light, or sickness is the absence of health, evil is a defect, a lack, or a turning away from the goodness that ought to be present.11 It entered the world not by God’s design, but through the misuse of free will by created beings (both angelic and human), who chose to turn away from the ultimate good (God) toward lesser, changeable goods.13<br />
This leads to the doctrine of Original Sin and Total Depravity.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Original Sin:</strong> Humanity was created good but, through the representative act of the first humans, fell from its original state of holiness and communion with God. This fallen state is called “sin” only analogically; it is a sin that is “contracted” and not “committed” by individuals.16 This means that infants are not personally culpable or guilty for Adam’s specific act of disobedience. Rather, they are born into a corrupted state, deprived of original justice and grace with which humanity was created.16</li>
  <li><strong>Total Depravity:</strong> This doctrine clarifies the <em>extent</em> of that inherited corruption. It does not mean that humans are as evil as they could possibly be, nor that they are incapable of performing acts that are good by human standards (like loving their children). Rather, “total” refers to the fact that sin has corrupted the <em>total person</em>—every faculty, including the mind, emotions, and will, is affected and biased against God. It means that, left to ourselves, we are “utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good” that relates to God and are unable to do anything to merit salvation.</li>
</ul>

  </h3>
      

<p>This section integrates the difficult reality of suffering and seemingly unjust events into the framework of a benevolent and sovereign God. It moves beyond a simple “defense” (arguing that God and evil can logically coexist) to offer a “theodicy”—a plausible framework for understanding <em>why</em> God permits evil.19</p>
  <h4 id="1-a-theodicy-of-soul-making">
    
    
     <a href="#1-a-theodicy-of-soul-making">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top"><strong>1. A Theodicy of Soul-Making</strong></a>
        
    
  </h4>
      

<p>The presence of evil and suffering is the most significant challenge to theism. A robust response can be constructed by combining two major theological traditions. First, the Augustinian view establishes that evil is a consequence of the Fall, a disruption of the good order of creation resulting from humanity’s turn from God.19<br />
Second, the Irenaean or “soul-making” theodicy explains the <em>purpose</em> God allows suffering to serve in this fallen world. This view posits a two-stage creation process: God created humanity in His “image,” with the raw potential for moral perfection, but the journey to achieve His “likeness” requires moral and spiritual development.19 In a world marred by sin, suffering and hardship become the necessary context for developing profound virtues like compassion, courage, perseverance, and faith.23 To allow for this genuine moral development, God maintains a degree of “epistemic distance,” meaning He does not make His existence so overwhelmingly obvious as to compel belief, thus preserving our freedom.19<br />
This theodicy must also confront horrendous evils, like the Holocaust, which seem to offer no redemptive value.25 While no explanation can remove the horror, the framework suggests that from an eternal perspective, God can redeem even the most incomprehensible suffering, leading to a “good of such surpassing value” in the afterlife that it justifies the painful means.22</p>
  <h4 id="2-divine-justice-and-the-flood">
    
    
     <a href="#2-divine-justice-and-the-flood">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top"><strong>2. Divine Justice and the Flood</strong></a>
        
    
  </h4>
      

<p>The Genesis flood was a divine judgment upon a world where corruption and violence had become pervasive, affecting “all flesh”.26 It is critical to note the textual detail that God “grieved” and His “heart was filled with pain” (Genesis 6:6), framing the flood not as an act of a capricious, angry deity, but as a sorrowful and necessary response to the catastrophic state of human-led corruption.28 The destruction of animals was a tragic consequence of their entanglement with a corrupted humanity; as part of the sin-infested world, they were viewed as morally contaminated by association and part of the creation that needed to be remade.<br />
The theological core of the narrative is revealed in the <em>inclusio</em> (literary bookends) formed by Genesis 6:5 and Genesis 8:21. Both verses describe the human heart’s inclination as evil, demonstrating that the flood, while a just judgment, did not and could not solve the root problem of sin.30 This powerfully illustrates that cataclysmic force cannot eradicate evil from the human heart, thus foreshadowing the need for a different, more profound solution—a redemptive act of grace, which the Christian tradition identifies in the atonement offered through Christ.</p>

<p>This final section clarifies the nature of spiritual beings and provides a coherent understanding of the ultimate states of existence, particularly the complex doctrine of Hell.</p>
  <h4 id="1-the-spiritual-hierarchy-angels-demons-and-satan">
    
    
     <a href="#1-the-spiritual-hierarchy-angels-demons-and-satan">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top"><strong>1. The Spiritual Hierarchy: Angels, Demons, and Satan</strong></a>
        
    
  </h4>
      

<p>Spiritual beings exist as mediators between the transcendent and temporal realms.33</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Angels:</strong> The term derives from the Greek <em>angelos</em>, meaning “messenger”.34 They are benevolent spiritual beings who remained faithful in their service to God.</li>
  <li><strong>Satan:</strong> This name comes from the Hebrew <em>śāṭān</em>, meaning “adversary” or “accuser”.36 He is understood in Christian theology as a high-ranking angel, a “guardian cherub” named Lucifer (“light-bearer”), who, through pride and a desire to usurp God’s sovereignty, rebelled against his Creator. His fall from grace transformed him from a being of wisdom and beauty into God’s chief adversary.</li>
  <li><strong>Demons:</strong> These are the other angels who freely chose to follow Satan in his rebellion. It is believed that a third of the angelic host fell, as symbolically depicted in Revelation 12:4.38 They are not “corrupted messages,” but fallen spiritual beings who now actively oppose God’s will and work to deceive and destroy humanity.28</li>
</ul>
  <h4 id="2-the-nature-of-hell-a-synthesis-of-models">
    
    
     <a href="#2-the-nature-of-hell-a-synthesis-of-models">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top"><strong>2. The Nature of Hell: A Synthesis of Models</strong></a>
        
    
  </h4>
      

<p>The nature of Hell is a complex theological topic. A coherent view can be synthesized from three major historical models. The logical progression is from choice, to experience, to consequence.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The Choice for Separation:</strong> The process begins with a free and final choice. Influenced by writers like C.S. Lewis, this view sees Hell as the logical outcome of a soul’s definitive self-exclusion from God, who is the source of all goodness, life, and love. The gates of Hell are “locked from the inside” by the soul that has chosen its own autonomy over communion with God.39</li>
  <li><strong>The Experience of Torment:</strong> This choice leads to a specific eternal experience. The Eastern Orthodox tradition argues that since God is omnipresent, Hell cannot be separation <em>from</em> God’s presence, but is rather the agonizing <em>experience</em> of His infinite love by a soul that has irrevocably oriented itself toward hatred.39 For a soul that loves God, His presence is bliss (Heaven); for a soul that hates Him, that same presence is torment.</li>
  <li><strong>The Consequence of Justice:</strong> This experience constitutes a just punishment. The traditional punitive view, drawing from texts like Revelation 14:9-12, sees Hell as a state of active, eternal punishment inflicted by God’s righteous wrath.</li>
</ol>

<p>Synthesizing these, Hell is the eternal state that results from a soul’s <em>choice</em> for self-exclusion, which leads to the eternal <em>experience</em> of God’s presence as torment, which <em>constitutes</em> the just <em>consequence</em> of sin.</p>
