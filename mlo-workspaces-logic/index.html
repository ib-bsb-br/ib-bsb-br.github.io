        "<p>So I’m a loooooooong-time user (early 2000’s) of MLO and have configured and used it in many different ways over the years, trying to leverage the full power of this amazing tool to capture all my interests and to-do items across all my Areas of Focus, Interest, and Responsibility, present them in clean, organized, and optimized and relevant lists, and do all that in as efficiently and easily as possible. It’s been a long journey of testing, trying things out, chucking out ideas that didn’t work, going back to the drawing board, re-investigating MLO features and how to leverage them And today, using a combination of flags, folders, projects, outlines, lists, importance, urgency, contexts, and some very fancy Advanced Filtered Views, I have a system that truly captures “everything” in an almost perfect system and process that is easy to use, update, and add to. But over the years, the one feature that has eluded my understanding has been Workspaces. I’ve never been able to come up with a way to leverage WS to make my system more efficient and easier to use. I’ve always ended up abandoning any configuration that included them because they inevitably ended up complicating things and slowing things down, becoming cumbersome and unwieldy. Now, I want to be clear, this is completely a failing on my part to understand how they were meant to be used, and not the result of a poor or pointless design. I’ve never seemed to be able to get my head around how to use them right, and I’ve never liked that. If there’s a way for a tool to help make things easier to manage, I want to utilize it. So with that in mind, I set out this week to finally be able to check off “complete MLO setup” in my “implement GTD” project :)</p>\n

What I’ve come to understand about Workspaces is as follows:</p>\n
