Ensure the expansion is accurate, comprehensive, relevant, and strictly maintains the original tone and focus.
The AI assistant is advanced and capable of self-correction. The expansion requires elaborating on existing points, adding relevant examples, and introducing related sub-points where appropriate. The primary goal is to add substantive value (e.g., deeper explanations, details on 'how' and 'why'), not merely increase word count. The final output will be evaluated for target length, relevance, clarity, substance, lack of repetition, and logical flow.
1.  Retrieve and thoroughly review the complete text of the specific AI response targeted for expansion (i.e., the response immediately prior to the user's expansion request in the current conversation).
2.  Identify the core message, key arguments, main points, structure, and overall tone of that original response.
3.  Brainstorm potential areas for elaboration, specific examples that could be added, supporting details, and logical sub-topics relevant to the existing content.
4.  Evaluate the identified points from the original response to determine where expansion would add the most value (e.g., enhancing clarity, providing depth, adding supporting evidence).
5.  Critically assess the brainstormed examples, details, and sub-topics for direct relevance and logical coherence, ensuring they support or extend the original points without deviating from the core purpose.
6.  Consider the target length (approx. double) and plan how to distribute the additional content effectively across the original structure to maintain balance and narrative flow.
7.  Analyze the original tone and writing style to ensure the newly generated content integrates seamlessly and consistently.
Develop a structured, detailed plan for executing the expansion. This plan should outline:
* Which specific sections or points of the original response will be expanded.
* What specific details, explanations, examples, or data points will be added to each targeted section.
* Which new, related sub-points (if any) will be introduced and where they fit logically within the existing structure.
* A strategy to ensure the final text flows logically, transitions smoothly, and maintains a consistent tone throughout.
* A projection or check to ensure the planned additions are likely to achieve the target length increase substantively.
Draft the expanded response according to the formulated plan. During the drafting process:
* Systematically integrate the planned details, examples, and explanations into the text.
* Continuously self-correct and refine: check if additions genuinely add substance and value, not just verbosity. Ensure clarity and precision in wording.
* Pay close attention to transitions between original and new content, ensuring they are smooth and logical.
* Monitor the tone and relevance constantly, adjusting as needed to maintain consistency with the original response.
* Keep track of the evolving length to ensure it is progressing towards the target (roughly double).
Produce the final, expanded version of the response. This output should incorporate all planned additions and refinements made during the execution and self-correction phase, resulting in a cohesive, comprehensive, and significantly more detailed text compared to the original.
Before finalizing, review the generated expanded text against the initial requirements and goals:
* Is the length approximately double the original?
* Has the core message, original tone, and focus been strictly maintained?
* Is the added content relevant, accurate, substantial, and well-integrated?
* Does the text flow logically? Is it clear, coherent, and easy to understand?
* Are there any unintended redundancies, awkward phrasing, or areas that could be further polished?
Based on the preceding analysis and plan, generate the expanded version of your response that immediately preceded this request. The expanded text must be approximately double the original length.

Analyze the underlying business drivers (e.g., market agility, cost reduction, scalability, compliance, talent attraction). Explicitly consider the opportunity cost – what strategic features or initiatives are being deferred to undertake this refactoring? Challenge the objective if necessary: ‘What is the quantifiable evidence that this specific refactoring solution is the most effective way to address the identified problem?’ ‘Have alternative, less disruptive approaches (e.g., targeted optimizations, tactical wrappers) been adequately evaluated?’ ‘What are the specific, measurable business outcomes expected, and how will they be tracked?’Exhaustive Ecosystem Artifact Identification &amp; Dependency Mapping: Systematically and exhaustively identify all potentially affected artifacts across the entire socio-technical system. Employ a multi-pronged, evidence-based approach:Automated Analysis: Leverage advanced dependency analysis tools, visualizing complex dependency graphs (code, infrastructure, data). Utilize SAST/DAST tools, linters, and code quality platforms (SonarQube) to baseline current state and identify areas impacted by proposed changes. Analyze CI/CD logs and deployment manifests for implicit dependencies.Targeted Search &amp; Pattern Recognition: Perform sophisticated searches across codebases, configuration repositories, documentation wikis, and issue trackers for specific API usage, deprecated patterns, anti-patterns, configuration keys, hardcoded values, relevant architectural decisions (ADRs), and operational incidents related to the target area.Manual Tracing, Exploration &amp; Interviews: Manually trace critical business transactions and data flows end-to-end. Review key code sections, database schemas (including stored procedures, triggers, functions, data lineage), message queue/event stream definitions and schemas, external/internal API contracts (and their consumers/providers), infrastructure-as-code definitions (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.), operational runbooks, disaster recovery plans, capacity plans, compliance documentation (e.g., GDPR impact assessment, SOX controls), and security policies. Conduct targeted interviews with domain experts, operations staff, security teams, and architects.Consider All Artifact Types: Add more detail on how to handle dependencies between different artifact types. For example: ‘If a database schema is changed, how does this impact ORM mappings, data access layers, and UI components that display the data?’ Look beyond primary code to include: configuration files (all formats), environment variables, feature flag definitions/usage, build scripts (all types), CI/CD pipeline definitions/scripts, containerization files (Dockerfile, compose), deployment manifests (K8s, Helm, Terraform, CloudFormation), unit/integration/E2E/performance/contract/security test suites, database schemas/migrations/seed data/stored procedures, API documentation (internal/external), system design documents, architectural diagrams/ADRs, runbooks/playbooks, monitoring/alerting configs, logging configurations, security policies/controls, compliance evidence, cost models/reports, user documentation, training materials, and even team structure/skill matrices.Detail the precise nature and severity of the impact for each identified component. Critically distinguish and elaborate on:Direct Modifications: Code/artifacts requiring explicit changes. Specify the type of change (e.g., API signature change, logic rewrite, dependency upgrade, schema alteration).Indirect Consequences: Add more specific examples of indirect consequences, such as: ‘If a library is upgraded, how does this affect all modules that use that library, including potential version conflicts or API changes?’ Components relying on modified code. Analyze API contracts meticulously (including implicit contracts). Consider impacts on derived classes, dependent services, data consumers/producers, and UI components. Assess the difficulty of adapting these dependencies.Potential Ripple Effects (NFRs &amp; Systemic Qualities): Analyze impacts quantitatively or qualitatively across:Performance: Baseline key metrics (latency percentiles, throughput, resource utilization). Estimate potential changes and define performance testing requirements.Security: Analyze changes to attack surface, potential introduction/mitigation of specific CWEs, impact on authentication/authorization/encryption, data privacy/residency implications. Define security validation requirements (threat modeling, pen testing).Reliability: Analyze impact on failure modes, error handling, fault tolerance mechanisms, MTBF/MTTR. Define reliability testing needs (e.g., chaos engineering experiments).Maintainability: Code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity), readability, testability, ease of debugging, adherence to coding standards.Operability: Impact on deployment frequency/safety, monitoring effectiveness, logging usefulness, ease of troubleshooting, configuration management complexity.Usability: Add examples of specific usability considerations, such as: ‘Will the refactoring introduce any changes to user workflows? Will it require updates to user documentation or training materials?’ Potential changes to user workflows or interfaces, even if unintentional.Specify the required output format for this analysis to enable clear prioritization and risk assessment. For example: ‘Generate a detailed, sortable, and filterable table listing each affected component (precise identifier), its type, the specific nature of impact, a detailed description of change/interaction, estimated complexity (e.g., Fibonacci scale), likelihood of impact occurring (Low/Med/High), potential severity if impact occurs (Low/Med/High), detectability (Easy/Med/Hard), proposed priority (P1-P4), confidence level of this assessment (Low/Med/High), and initial thoughts on mitigation difficulty.’Generate a Comprehensive, Strategic, Economic, and Actionable Refactoring Plan Document:Strategic Program Blueprint: Construct a detailed, well-organized document titled “Refactoring Plan”. Emphasize its role as the definitive blueprint, central communication artifact, economic justification, risk management framework, and living guide for a potentially long-running, multi-team initiative.Strategic Goals (SMART, Aligned, Measured): Clearly articulate the primary Goals, ensuring they are SMART, directly linked to business OKRs/KPIs and technical strategy (e.g., specific architectural principles, quality attribute targets based on ISO 25010). Define both leading indicators (predicting success during the program) and lagging indicators (measuring success after completion). Add more specific examples of leading and lagging indicators. For example: ‘Leading indicators: % of code refactored, test coverage of refactored code, number of critical vulnerabilities identified and fixed. Lagging indicators: reduction in bug reports, improvement in deployment frequency, reduction in mean time to recovery (MTTR), increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS) due to improved system reliability.’Compelling Rationale &amp; Economic Justification: Provide a robust, data-driven Rationale. Include a formal Cost-Benefit Analysis section: estimate total costs (developer effort, infrastructure changes, tooling, training, potential disruption/downtime, opportunity cost) versus quantifiable benefits (reduced maintenance costs, increased development velocity, improved performance/reliability leading to revenue/retention gains, new market capabilities enabled, specific risk reduction). Calculate estimated ROI or payback period where feasible. Justify the effort against concrete alternatives with their own cost/benefit profiles. Use metrics (code churn, bug density, complexity scores, lead time for changes) to quantify the “cost of inaction.”Granular, Phased Technical Approach (Patterns, Strategies, Observability): Describe the proposed technical Approach in extensive, granular detail, likely broken into distinct phases or workstreams. Outline sequences, specific patterns, algorithms, architectural changes, data handling/migration strategies, and crucially, the observability strategy during the refactoring. Explicitly detail:Preparatory Steps: E.g., enhancing test coverage to a specific target percentage, establishing detailed baseline performance/reliability metrics, setting up required infrastructure/tooling/environments, performing necessary dependency upgrades first, creating Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for key choices.Core Refactoring Steps: Break down major transformations into smaller, verifiable sub-steps. Detail strategies for complex scenarios like database schema evolution (zero-downtime techniques like expand/contract, parallel run with feature flags, trigger-based synchronization), monolith decomposition (Strangler Fig implementation, anti-corruption layers, event-driven decoupling patterns, API gateway integration), managing parallel refactoring efforts across teams (defining clear interfaces, integration points, coordination mechanisms).API Versioning Strategy: Define how APIs will be versioned and managed during the transition to minimize disruption for consumers.Feature Flag Strategy: Detail implementation, rollout strategy (canary, blue-green, percentage-based), A/B testing capabilities if applicable, robust monitoring of flag impact, and rigorous flag cleanup process/timeline.Observability Plan: Define specific metrics, logs, and traces needed to monitor the health, performance, and correctness of both old and new code paths during the transition. Specify required dashboards and alerting.Integration &amp; Verification: Define branching strategy (potentially long-lived release branches for large efforts), CI/CD pipeline adaptations (e.g., parallel pipelines, environment promotion strategy), incremental integration points, and rigorous verification at each stage (automated tests, code reviews, architectural reviews, manual checks).Post-Refactoring Cleanup &amp; Handover: Detail steps for decommissioning old code/flags/infrastructure, updating all relevant documentation comprehensively, final end-to-end validation, knowledge transfer to operations/support teams, and potentially a post-mortem analysis.Data Migration Strategy: Add more detail on how to handle potential data migration challenges. For example: ‘If the refactoring involves changes to the database schema, provide a detailed migration plan, including data validation, rollback procedures, and potential downtime considerations. Consider different migration strategies, such as blue-green deployments or online schema changes.’ Provide a detailed plan for data migration if needed, including validation, rollback, and potential downtime considerations.Elaborate significantly and proactively on potential Risks, brainstorming exhaustively and realistically across categories (Technical, Process, Organizational, Financial, Security, Compliance, External Dependencies). Include complex risks like cascading failures during transition, data corruption undetected for periods, long-running branch divergence hell, team burnout/attrition, knowledge silos hindering progress, configuration drift across complex environments, regulatory/compliance violations introduced, or critical third-party dependencies failing.For each significant identified risk, propose concrete, practical, verifiable, and potentially layered Mitigation Strategies. Include advanced techniques where appropriate: rigorous code reviews (consider checklists), pair/mob programming, comprehensive automated testing pyramid (unit, integration, component, contract, E2E, performance, security scanning, mutation testing) with specific coverage/quality goals, feature flags/toggles, canary releases/blue-green deployments with fine-grained monitoring and automated rollback triggers, dedicated integration/staging environments mirroring production, chaos engineering principles to test resilience, frequent small commits/pushes integrated via robust CI/CD with automated quality gates, automated rollback capabilities (code/config/data), comprehensive data backup/validation/restore drills, formal ADRs for critical decisions, regular stakeholder demos and transparent progress reporting, very clear Definition of Done, external security audits/pen-testing, dedicated refactoring teams or protected time, formal knowledge sharing mechanisms, and potentially architectural fitness functions. Expand on the concept of architectural fitness functions. For example: ‘Define specific architectural fitness functions (automated tests that measure architectural qualities like performance, security, and maintainability) to ensure the refactoring doesn’t degrade the overall architecture. These functions should be continuously monitored throughout the refactoring process.’Include Comprehensive, Detailed Dedicated Sections:Multi-Level Testing Strategy: Define scope, goals, tools, environments, responsibilities, test data management (generation/masking/subsetting), and acceptance criteria for each relevant testing level (unit, integration, component, contract, API, E2E, UAT, performance, load, stress, security, usability, accessibility, disaster recovery, rollback). Include strategy for maintaining test suites during heavy code churn. Add exploratory testing charters.Robust, Validated Rollback Plan: Define precise quantitative triggers for rollback, detailed step-by-step procedures (automated where possible) for reverting code/config/data across all affected systems, validation procedures post-rollback, communication plan during rollback execution, and plan for post-rollback root cause analysis.Integrated Security Validation Plan: Outline when (design, implementation, testing, deployment), how (SAST, DAST, IAST, SCA, manual code review, pen-testing, threat modeling updates, compliance checks), and by whom security will be assessed. Define specific security acceptance criteria and processes for handling identified vulnerabilities.Stakeholder Communication Plan &amp; Matrix: Add a section on ‘Communication and Collaboration Strategy’. This section should detail how the refactoring effort will be communicated to stakeholders, how collaboration will be facilitated between teams, and how conflicts will be resolved. This is crucial for large-scale refactoring projects.Example:’Communication and Collaboration Strategy: Define a clear communication and collaboration strategy to ensure all stakeholders are informed and aligned.Stakeholder Identification and Analysis: Identify all stakeholders (internal and external) and their needs.Communication Channels and Frequency: Define communication channels (e.g., regular meetings, email updates, shared documentation) and frequency for each stakeholder group.Collaboration Mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for collaboration between teams (e.g., shared repositories, communication tools, joint workshops).Conflict Resolution Process: Define a process for resolving conflicts that may arise during the refactoring effort.’Resource Allocation, Skills &amp; Budget: Identify teams/individuals, required skills (include skill gap analysis and training plan if needed), dependencies on shared resources/platforms, detailed effort estimation (e.g., using multiple techniques), realistic timeline with phases/milestones/buffers, and allocated budget.Rigorous Definition of Done (DoD): Define specific, verifiable, agreed-upon criteria for program completion. Provide concrete acceptance conditions and how they will be verified and signed off by specific roles (e.g., Architect, Security Officer, Product Owner, SRE Lead, Business Sponsor).Define the Scope Explicitly, Rigorously, Defensively, Collaboratively, and Visually:Contractual &amp; Visual Scope Section: Integrate a distinct, unambiguous “Scope” section. Explicitly state its purpose as a contract. Use visualization techniques (e.g., architectural diagrams, context maps based on Domain-Driven Design principles) to clearly delineate boundaries.Precise In-Scope Definition: List precisely all artifacts in scope, using unambiguous identifiers. Clearly state the intended change type.Aggressive &amp; Justified Out-of-Scope Definition: Explicitly, extensively, and proactively list anything out of scope, providing the rationale for each exclusion to prevent ambiguity and manage expectations.Formal Scope Change Control Process: Detail the formal process for handling scope change requests, including impact assessment (effort, timeline, risk, cost, dependencies), approval workflow, and integration with program governance and delivery cadences (e.g., sprint planning, PI planning).Identify, Characterize, Justify, Track, and Analyze the Preliminary Change Set:Initial Footprint Prediction &amp; Justification: Compile the preliminary Change Set list based on analysis/scope. Justify the prediction.Categorization, Utility &amp; Tracking: Categorize files clearly. Explain utility for tracking, reviews, CI/CD, parallel work planning. Discuss linking files to work items/tickets. Analyze the set for potential hotspots (frequently changed files needing extra coordination) or impacts on build/deployment infrastructure. Consider using this to inform static analysis rule configurations during the refactoring.Purpose, Limitations &amp; Evolution: Emphasize this is a preliminary estimate expected to evolve. Stress the importance of tracking the actual change set against this baseline to identify scope drift or unexpected impacts early.Embed Iterative Refinement, Continuous Feedback, and Adaptive Governance:Living Document &amp; Governance: Conclude the plan by stating it’s a living document governed by the defined change control process.Review Checkpoints &amp; Cadence: Recommend specific checkpoints, review gates, or cadences (e.g., end-of-phase reviews, quarterly program reviews) where the plan’s validity, assumptions, risks, scope, timeline, and budget are formally reassessed and adapted based on learnings and evolving context.Feedback Loop &amp; Metrics: Emphasize incorporating feedback from retrospectives (specifically focused on the refactoring process), code reviews, testing, monitoring data, and stakeholder input. Define leading metrics to track if the plan is on course before major milestones are missed.Generate a program plan that embodies exceptional thoroughness, strategic alignment, economic awareness, proactive risk management, actionable detail, and adaptive governance, thereby maximizing the probability of a successful, predictable, and high-value enterprise-scale refactoring initiative.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Matthias Steiner lift</title><link href="https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Matthias Steiner lift" /><published>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T08:36:45+00:00</updated><id>https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift/"><![CDATA[<video controls="">

  <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> You install Ventoy onto the external drive once. It creates boot partitions and leaves the remaining space as a large data partition (usually exFAT or NTFS). You then simply copy your OS installer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.iso</code> files, WinPE images (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.iso</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.wim</code>), and even full Windows installations packaged in virtual hard disk files (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhd</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhdx</code>) onto this data partition. When you boot from the Ventoy drive, it scans the data partition and presents a menu listing all compatible files, allowing you to boot directly from them.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Extremely easy to set up and manage – just copy/delete files to add/remove OS options.</li>
      <li>No complex manual partitioning required for each OS.</li>
      <li>Excellent compatibility with UEFI (including Secure Boot) and Legacy BIOS modes.</li>
      <li>Supports a wide variety of image types (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.iso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.wim</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.img</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vhd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vhdx</code>).</li>
      <li>Supports persistence for many Linux live ISOs (saving changes across boots, requires creating a persistence file).</li>
      <li>Can directly boot full Windows installations from VHD(x) files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Slight boot overhead compared to a direct installation (usually negligible).</li>
      <li>Performance of OSs running from VHD(x) depends on the VHD type (fixed vs. dynamic), the underlying drive speed, and the USB connection.</li>
      <li>While compatibility is high, rare niche ISOs might have issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Setup Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Ventoy tool from the official website.</li>
      <li>Run the tool and install Ventoy onto your 1TB external HDD (this will erase the drive initially!). Choose the desired partition scheme (MBR for legacy, GPT for UEFI recommended).</li>
      <li>Once Ventoy is installed, the drive will appear with a large partition. Copy your desired files onto this partition:
        <ul>
          <li>Linux ISOs (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubuntu-lts.iso</code>)</li>
          <li>Windows Installer ISOs (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows11.iso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows81.iso</code>)</li>
          <li>WinPE ISOs or WIMs.</li>
          <li><strong>For full Windows installs (Win 11/8.1 To Go style):</strong> Create a VHD(x) file first:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Method A (Recommended): Install directly to VHD:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disk Management</code> (diskmgmt.msc) in Windows to create a new VHD(x) file (choose VHDX, Fixed size for better performance, allocate sufficient space like 64GB+).</li>
                  <li>Attach the created VHD(x) file in Disk Management (it will appear as a new uninitialized disk). Initialize it (GPT recommended) and create a simple volume (format NTFS).</li>
                  <li>Boot your computer using a standard Windows Installer USB/ISO (you can even boot the Windows ISO via Ventoy itself).</li>
                  <li>At the “Where do you want to install Windows?” screen, press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift+F10</code> to open Command Prompt. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diskpart</code> commands to list volumes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list volume</code>) identify the drive letter of your attached VHD, and select the correct partition.</li>
                  <li>Proceed with the installation, selecting the partition on the attached VHD as the target.</li>
                  <li>After installation completes <em>inside the VHD</em>, detach the VHD in Disk Management.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Method B (Capture Existing):</strong> Use a tool like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disk2vhd</code> (from Microsoft Sysinternals) to capture an existing Windows installation into a VHD(x) file.</li>
              <li>Copy the final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhdx</code> file onto the Ventoy data partition.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Safely eject the drive. Boot your target computer from the USB drive. Ventoy’s menu should appear, allowing you to select and boot your desired OS image or VHD.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>Save the service file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/system/backup-opensuse.service</code></li>
  <li>Save the timer file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/system/backup-opensuse.timer</code></li>
  <li>Enable and start the timer:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable backup-opensuse.timer
sudo systemctl start backup-opensuse.timer

<h2 id="1-understanding-nginx-unit-in-directadmin">1. Understanding Nginx Unit in DirectAdmin</h2>

<p>DirectAdmin integrates Nginx Unit as a polyglot application server that supports multiple languages and their versions. According to the <a href="https://docs.directadmin.com/webservices/nginx_unit/">DirectAdmin documentation</a>, you can access Nginx Unit functionality through:</p>

<h2 id="2-creating-a-flask-application-structure">2. Creating a Flask Application Structure</h2>

<p>Let’s create a production-ready Flask application structure:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/static
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/templates
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/models
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/views
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/logs
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/instance
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure follows Flask best practices with separation of concerns and a dedicated instance folder for configuration files that shouldn’t be in version control.</p>

<h2 id="5-environment-variables-management">5. Environment Variables Management</h2>

<p>For production environments, sensitive information should be managed securely. Create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file in the instance directory:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add environment variables to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FLASK_APP=wsgi.py
FLASK_CONFIG=production
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost/dbname
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then create a custom <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.py</code> in the instance directory to load these variables:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">os</span>

<h2 id="9-enhanced-security-with-filesystem-isolation">9. Enhanced Security with Filesystem Isolation</h2>

<p>Nginx Unit provides filesystem isolation via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rootfs</code> option. This feature restricts your application’s access to only the specified directory, enhancing security.</p>

<p>While the DirectAdmin UI may not expose all isolation options directly, you can update the configuration using the API. Here’s an example of how to add filesystem isolation:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">-X</span> PUT <span class="nt">--unix-socket</span> /var/run/unit/control.sock <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s1">'{
    "isolation": {
      "rootfs": "/home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app",
      "namespaces": {
        "mount": true
      }
    }
  }'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  http://localhost/config/applications/flask_app/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">namespaces.mount</code> set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> enhances security by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pivot_root</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chroot</code>, preventing common chroot escape techniques.</p>

<h2 id="10-creating-route-in-directadmin-ui">10. Creating Route in DirectAdmin UI</h2>

<ol>
  <li>From the Nginx Unit page, click <strong>Create Route</strong></li>
  <li>Fill in the following details:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Domain</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example.com</code></li>
      <li><strong>Application</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flask_app</code></li>
      <li><strong>Add Static Files Route</strong>: Check this option</li>
      <li><strong>Static Files Path</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/static</code></li>
      <li><strong>Static Files URI</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/static/*</code></li>

Economical backup solution: rsync and ssh
—————————————–</p>

<p>As all other unix tricks this is also the result of laziness and the need. I wanted to backup data on my windows laptop to a central linux/unix server. I didn’t want all the features of available expensive backup solutions. Just a simple updated copy of my data on a central machine which is backed up to the tape daily. rsync is known for fast incremental transfer and was an obvious choice for the purpose.</p>

<p>We have a unix machine at our workplace which has a directory structure /backup/username allocated for backing up user data. rsync has a client/server architecture, where rsync client talks to an rsync daemon at the server side (This statement may not be completely true. I am not sure and don’t care also. You can refer to rsync manpage for complete discussion over rsync.). rsync client can connect to rsync server directly or through other remote transport programs like rsh, ssh etc. I decided to use ssh for transport for security and simplicity.</p>

<p>rsync daemon requires a configuration file rsyncd.conf. For my use, I have set it up like this:</p>

<p>[manu@amusbocldmon01 ~]$ cat rsyncd.conf
use chroot = no
[backup]
        path = /backup
        read only = no
        comment = backup area</p>

<p>This says,</p>

<p>-do no chroot (required because I’ll run it as a non-root user)<br />
-[backup] specifies a module named backup.<br />
-/backup is the path to backup module on filesystem</p>

<p>That’s all we need at the server side. We don’t need to keep rsync deamon running on the server. We’ll start rsync daemon from the client using ssh before starting the backup.</p>

<p>At Windows side, we need rsync and some ssh client. rsync is available for windows through cygwin port. You can download cygwin from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>. While installing cygwin, remember to select rsync. For ssh client, you can either use ssh that comes with cygwin or plink command line tool that comes with putty. Since, I have already set up my putty for password-less authentication using public/private key pair and pageant, I’ll demonstrate this solution using plink. However you can use any other ssh client too. You can download putty and plink from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/.</a> You can find much information about ssh password less authentication on the web. To keep commands short, add rsync and plink to Windows path. Let’s start our backup now.</p>

<p>First, we need to start rsync daemon at the server. It can be started from the client using following command:</p>

<p>plink -v -t -l manu fileserver.local.com rsync –daemon –port=1873 –config=$HOME/rsyncd.conf</p>

<p>where, fileserver.local.com is the central server where we are going to store our data. This logs in user ‘manu’ on fileserver and starts a rsync daemon there at the port 1873. rsync goes to the background and plink returns immediately.</p>

<p>Next we need to setup an ssh transport tunnel using plink:</p>

<p>plink -v -N -L 873:localhost:1873 -l manu fileserver.local.com</p>

<p>This sets up the local port forwarding – forwarding local port 873 to port 1873 on the remote server.</p>

<p>After running this, we have port 873 on our windows box connected to the port 1873 on the fileserver on which rsync daemon is listening. So, now we just need to run rsync on windows machine with localhost as the target server:</p>

<p>rsync -av src 127.0.0.1::backup/manu</p>

<p>This command copies file or dir ‘<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code>’ incrementally to directory ‘<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manu</code>’ inside ‘backup’ module. Since this rsync is the one that comes with cygwin, it understand only cygwin paths for the files. For that reason, ‘src’ needs to be specified in cygwin terms. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D:\project </code>becomes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/cygdrive/d/project</code> in cygwin terms.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-in-scripts">Putting it all in scripts:</h2>

<p>This trick is not much handy, unless you put it in the scripts and make it easy to run. To automate the process, I created 2 small scripts:</p>

<p>plink_rsync.bat: (To start plink for rsync)</p>

<p>REM Start rsync daemon the server
plink -v -t %* rsync –daemon –port=1873 –config=$HOME/rsyncd.conf
REM Setup ssh transport tunnel.
plink -v -N -L 873:localhost:1873 %*</p>

<p>runrsync.bat: (Main script - calls plink_rsync.bat and starts rsync)</p>

<p>REM Start plink_rsync.bat
START /MIN “PLINK_FOR_RSYNC” plink_rsync.bat -l manu fileserver.local.com
REM Sleep for 15 seconds to give plink enough time to finish
sleep 15
REM Iterate through filenames in filelist.txt and rsync them
for /F “delims=” %%i in (filelist.txt) do rsync -av %%i 127.0.0.1::backup/manu
REM Kill plink_rsync.bat window
TASKKILL /T /F /FI “WINDOWTITLE eq PLINK_FOR_RSYNC *”
REM Kill remote rsync daemon
plink -l manu fileserver.local.com pkill rsync</p>

<p>The main script starts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plink_rsync.bat</code> in another window and sleeps for 15 seconds to make sure that connection is set up. Then it runs rsync over the files and directories list in<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> filelist.txt</code>. After rsyncing is done, it kills <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plink_rsync.bat</code> window and kills rsync daemon on the remote server by running pkill though plink.</p>

<p>filelist.txt contains the list of files and directories that you want to take backup of. For example, my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filelist.txt</code> contains:</p>

<p>filelist.txt:</p>

<p>“/cygdrive/d/Documents and Settings/501106700/My Documents/project”
“/cygdrive/d/Documents and Settings/501106700/My Documents/Outlook”
“/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Lotus/Sametime Client/Chat Transcripts”</p>

<p>You can schedule runrsync.bat to run everyday or every week depending on your requirement.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry></feed>
