RPI4 &amp; Ubuntu MATE - How to enable video acceleration</p>

<p>Updated: June 27, 2020</p>

<p>Let’s fix another problem. This is a big one, and technically speaking, the most important one. Because if you intend to use <a href="https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/raspberry-pi-4-viable-desktop.html">Raspberry Pi 4 as a desktop system</a>, like I do, then hardware acceleration is a critical component of the overall experience. What this translates to, in layman’s terms: smooth video playback with low system resource utilization and less heating.</p>

<p>By default, even the earlier Pi models could play 1080p movies without a problem. This means you ought to get solid results here, too. However, the default configuration is not (currently) optimized for a desktop experience, and we will need to make a few manual changes. Let me show you what you need to do on the system level first - and then how to allow Firefox, Chromium and VLC to use hardware acceleration. After me.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hd-video.jpg" alt="Image 1: Teaser" /></p>

<h2 id="update-system--install-libraries">Update system &amp; install libraries</h2>

<p>The first, basic step is to update the system:</p>

<p>sudo apt-get update<br />
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</p>

<p>Then, you need to install a few wee libraries:</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa libgles2-mesa-dev xorg-dev</p>

<h2 id="configuration-file-tweaks">Configuration file tweaks</h2>

<p>We talked about this in my guide on <a href="https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-fix-screen-resolution.html">how to fix the screen resolution in MATE</a>, where you end up having either black bars top and bottom, or a black border around your desktop, and a weird resolution like 1824x984 instead of full HD 1920x1080. I will briefly repeat some of the stuff, for clarity.</p>

<p>There are two ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the guided tool called raspi-config. However, it may not be present in MATE or work correctly.</li>
  <li>Manually change the boot configuration file that is used to setup the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would recommend you go for the manual change, because it also allows you to better understand what you’re doing. The boot configuration is stored in the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>32-bit Raspberry Pis (up to Model 3) under /boot/config.txt.</li>
  <li>64-bit Raspberry Pi (Model 4) under /boot/firmware/usercfg.txt.</li>
</ul>

<p>On Raspberry Pi, /boot/firmware/config.txt also exists, but this file tells you not to write changes to it directly, and to use usercfg.txt. At the bottom of the config.txt file, there’s an include statement, which will pull all your manual overrides from the usercfg.txt file. So this is where we want to make the change.</p>

<p>Open the file in a text editor as root or sudo:</p>

<p>sudo nano /boot/firmware/usercfg.txt</p>

<p>Then add the following lines in there:</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d<br />
max_framebuffers=2<br />
gpu_mem=128<br />
hdmi_enable_4kp60=1</p>

<p>What we’re doing here, we’re enabling the 3D video driver (so-called Fake KMS), and we set the memory to 128 MB - please note that Pi 4 does GPU memory management differently from previous models, and since there is a discrete processor for graphics, you don’t need as much as you would use on earlier hardware.</p>

<p>Now, there are two other drivers you can try, provided you don’t get the hardware acceleration working as you like. So instead of dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d, you can use:</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d</p>

<p>Or this one:</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d-pi4</p>

<p>You can also change the memory allocation for the GPU, but <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/memory.md">this is not a trivial topic</a>. So we won’t go into that at this point. Just be aware that you have some flexibility in how much memory you want to allocate. The amount of RAM your Pi has will also play a role in getting the number right. 128 MB ought to be fine.</p>

<h3 id="memory-splitting-and-cma-allocation">Memory splitting and CMA allocation</h3>

<p>One more trick you can do is memory splitting. Basically, you can tell how much memory is allocated to the GPU and how much goes to the CPU. Normally, the memory is allocated dynamically, but you can do your own split. What it actually means is that once this value is crossed (in MB), the GPU will either request more memory from the CPU, or relinquish some back - this can lead to potential performance bottlenecks during intense operations, hence the split allows you to pre-optimize for characteristic use cases. You can see this configuration if you run the raspi-config tool, for instance. It allows you to specify how much memory will be given to the CPU (ARM), and how much to the GPU (VideoCore).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-memory-split.png" alt="Image 2: Memory split" /></p>

<p>The actual setting is then (either kms or fkms) something like:</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d, cma-128</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d, cma-128</p>

<h2 id="reboot--check">Reboot &amp; check</h2>

<p>Once your Pi boots again, you can check that 3D drivers are loaded and working:</p>

<p>cat /proc/device-tree/soc/firmwarekms@7e600000/status</p>

<p>cat /proc/device-tree/v3dbus/v3d@7ec04000/status</p>

<p>If these two commands return okay, you have hardware acceleration on. If the result is disabled, try with a different dtoverlay option, reboot, and check again. Please be aware that you may not be able to turn the hardware acceleration on for some reason - kernel version, missing graphics stack utilities, etc. If that happens, just wait until the next system update.</p>

<h2 id="enable-hardware-acceleration-in-firefox">Enable hardware acceleration in Firefox</h2>

<p>Having your system with hardware acceleration is not enough. You also need to tell individual programs to use it. For whatever reason, neither Firefox nor Chromium have the right flags set by default. In Firefox, you can check the status with about:support. Go to Graphics and check the line that reads Compositing. If the value is Basic, you do not have hardware acceleration enabled.</p>

<p>To override, go to about:config, and search for the following key:</p>

<p>layers.acceleration.force-enabled</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-firefox-turn-layers-on.png" alt="Image 3: Firefox, turn layers on" /></p>

<p>And toggle it to true. Restart Firefox. Open the about:support page. The Compositing field should have the value OpenGL. Now you can watch videos as intended.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-firefox-compositing.png" alt="Image 4: Firefox, Compositing" /></p>

<h2 id="enable-hardware-acceleration-in-chromium">Enable hardware acceleration in Chromium</h2>

<p>Similarly, if you choose to use Chromium, it will initially report no HW acceleration under chrome://gpu. We can change that through chrome://flags. What you want is Override software rendering list, and change the setting to Enabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-chromium-experimental.png" alt="Image 5: Chromium, experimental features" /></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-chromium-gpu-flags.png" alt="Image 6: Chromium, GPU flags" /></p>

<p>Please note that some options will still read Disabled or Software only. This is because some of these are hardware-dependent (if you have say Windows and Nvidia graphics, do the same check, for fun), and some of these depend on OpenGL 3.0. To the best of my knowledge, Raspberry Pi only supports OpenGL 2.1.</p>

<h2 id="enable-hardware-acceleration-in-vlc">Enable hardware acceleration in VLC</h2>

<p>This is the simplest of the three. Tools &gt; Preferences. Click on Video. Under Video Settings &gt; Output, select OpenGL video output. Please note that if you’re trying this on a random distribution of choice, or if VLC has not been compiled with OpenGL, this won’t work, regardless of what your platform supports.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-vlc-opengl-output.png" alt="Image 7: VLC, OpenGL" /></p>

<h2 id="testing--results">Testing &amp; results</h2>

<p>And now, you need to actually fire up some nice video content and see what gives.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hd-video.jpg" alt="Image 8: HD video playback" /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I believe that over time, these issues will disappear, and you won’t be needing this guide. Well, I hope so. Looking at Ubuntu MATE - but also Raspberry Pi OS, the defaults are not designed with too much focus for desktop use just yet. That’s understandable, but for anyone who does seek to use the Pi as an ordinary mouse and keyboard system, this means a lot of extra work.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this tutorial has all the pieces you need to have an enjoyable multimedia experience. In the next article in this series, we will discuss, you guessed it, audio, a second and just as critical component. That would be all for now, stay tuned.</p>

## Leveraging `autorandr` for Seamless Projector and Monitor Connections on Raspberry Pi 4B (openSUSE Tumbleweed)

### Why Use `autorandr`?

`autorandr` automatically detects connected displays and applies pre-saved configurations, eliminating manual adjustments each time you connect to a new projector or monitor. This is ideal for professors frequently moving between classrooms with varying display setups.

### Benefits for Your Scenario:
- **Automatic Detection:** Automatically selects correct display configurations.
- **Ease of Use:** Eliminates repetitive manual configuration.
- **Flexibility:** Manages multiple display profiles easily.
- **Robustness:** Handles common EDID detection issues gracefully.

---

## Step-by-Step Installation and Configuration:

### Step 1: Install `autorandr`

**Recommended Method (openSUSE Build Service):**
```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:phillipberndt/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:phillipberndt.repo
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install autorandr
```

**Alternative Method (pip, limited integration):**
```bash
sudo pip install autorandr
```
*Note: pip installation may not integrate seamlessly with system services like systemd or udev.*

### Step 2: Create and Save Display Profiles

Connect to a projector or monitor, configure manually once, then save:
```bash
autorandr --save classroom_projector
```

Repeat for other setups:
```bash
autorandr --save ultrawide_monitor
```

### Step 3: Verify Saved Profiles
```bash
autorandr --list
```

### Step 4: Automatic Detection and Application

To apply configuration manually:
```bash
autorandr --change
```

To automate this completely, enable autorandr's systemd service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable autorandr.service
sudo systemctl start autorandr.service
```

### Step 5: Create a Default Fallback Profile

Create a generic fallback profile (e.g., 1920x1080):
```bash
autorandr --save default
```

Set as default:
```bash
autorandr --default default
```

---

## Advanced Usage:

### Wildcard EDID Matching (Practical Example)

Edit `~/.config/autorandr/classroom_projector/setup`:
```
HDMI-1 00ffffffffffff00*
```
This matches multiple similar projectors connected to HDMI-1.

---

## Alternative Hardware-Based Solution:

Consider using an **HDMI EDID Emulator** (dummy plug) for consistent EDID data and resolution compatibility without software configuration.

---

## Troubleshooting:

- **List Detected Profiles:**
```bash
autorandr --detected
```

- **Debugging Mode:**
```bash
autorandr --change --debug
```

---

## Official Documentation:

- [autorandr GitHub Repository](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr)
- [openSUSE Build Service autorandr Package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:phillipberndt/autorandr)

---

## Summary:

Using `autorandr`, you can seamlessly manage multiple projector and monitor configurations without manual intervention. Save common setups once, and `autorandr` automatically applies the correct configuration whenever you connect your Raspberry Pi 4B to a new projector or monitor. This simplifies your workflow, allowing you to focus on teaching rather than troubleshooting display issues.

Your primary function is to generate exceptionally detailed, strategically grounded, economically justified, and rigorously actionable refactoring program plans. These plans must proactively manage complex risks, maximize long-term value, and align tightly with business and technology strategy. Treat refactoring as a core component of continuous modernization, technical debt management, and enabling evolutionary architecture.When provided with a specific, high-level refactoring objective (e.g., “Migrate the core banking platform from mainframe COBOL to a cloud-native microservices architecture,” “Implement event sourcing across the e-commerce order fulfillment system,” “Standardize all data access layers onto a unified polyglot persistence strategy”) and rich, multi-dimensional context about the target ecosystem (including business drivers, strategic goals, existing architecture, technology stack, languages, frameworks, dependencies, build/deployment pipelines, testing infrastructure/maturity, operational environment/SLOs, SRE practices, team topology/skills, security posture, compliance requirements, and cost structures, even if hypothetical), execute the following comprehensive planning procedures.Your generated output should be a single, comprehensive document titled ‘Refactoring Program Plan’, containing distinct sections corresponding to the planning procedures outlined below (Impact Analysis, Plan Document, Scope Definition, etc.). Execute with exceptional rigor, foresight, strategic depth, and economic awareness:Perform In-Depth, Multi-Faceted, Risk-Aware, Quantitative Impact Analysis:Strategic Objective Deconstruction &amp; Validation:Thoroughly dissect the specified refactoring objective.

Critically evaluate its alignment with long-term business strategy, product roadmaps, and architectural vision. Analyze the underlying business drivers (e.g., market agility, cost reduction, scalability, compliance, talent attraction). Explicitly consider the opportunity cost – what strategic features or initiatives are being deferred to undertake this refactoring? Challenge the objective if necessary: ‘What is the quantifiable evidence that this specific refactoring solution is the most effective way to address the identified problem?’ ‘Have alternative, less disruptive approaches (e.g., targeted optimizations, tactical wrappers) been adequately evaluated?’ ‘What are the specific, measurable business outcomes expected, and how will they be tracked?’Exhaustive Ecosystem Artifact Identification &amp; Dependency Mapping: Systematically and exhaustively identify all potentially affected artifacts across the entire socio-technical system. Employ a multi-pronged, evidence-based approach:Automated Analysis: Leverage advanced dependency analysis tools, visualizing complex dependency graphs (code, infrastructure, data). Utilize SAST/DAST tools, linters, and code quality platforms (SonarQube) to baseline current state and identify areas impacted by proposed changes. Analyze CI/CD logs and deployment manifests for implicit dependencies.Targeted Search &amp; Pattern Recognition: Perform sophisticated searches across codebases, configuration repositories, documentation wikis, and issue trackers for specific API usage, deprecated patterns, anti-patterns, configuration keys, hardcoded values, relevant architectural decisions (ADRs), and operational incidents related to the target area.Manual Tracing, Exploration &amp; Interviews: Manually trace critical business transactions and data flows end-to-end. Review key code sections, database schemas (including stored procedures, triggers, functions, data lineage), message queue/event stream definitions and schemas, external/internal API contracts (and their consumers/providers), infrastructure-as-code definitions (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.), operational runbooks, disaster recovery plans, capacity plans, compliance documentation (e.g., GDPR impact assessment, SOX controls), and security policies. Conduct targeted interviews with domain experts, operations staff, security teams, and architects.Consider All Artifact Types: Add more detail on how to handle dependencies between different artifact types. For example: ‘If a database schema is changed, how does this impact ORM mappings, data access layers, and UI components that display the data?’ Look beyond primary code to include: configuration files (all formats), environment variables, feature flag definitions/usage, build scripts (all types), CI/CD pipeline definitions/scripts, containerization files (Dockerfile, compose), deployment manifests (K8s, Helm, Terraform, CloudFormation), unit/integration/E2E/performance/contract/security test suites, database schemas/migrations/seed data/stored procedures, API documentation (internal/external), system design documents, architectural diagrams/ADRs, runbooks/playbooks, monitoring/alerting configs, logging configurations, security policies/controls, compliance evidence, cost models/reports, user documentation, training materials, and even team structure/skill matrices.Detail the precise nature and severity of the impact for each identified component. Critically distinguish and elaborate on:Direct Modifications: Code/artifacts requiring explicit changes. Specify the type of change (e.g., API signature change, logic rewrite, dependency upgrade, schema alteration).Indirect Consequences: Add more specific examples of indirect consequences, such as: ‘If a library is upgraded, how does this affect all modules that use that library, including potential version conflicts or API changes?’ Components relying on modified code. Analyze API contracts meticulously (including implicit contracts). Consider impacts on derived classes, dependent services, data consumers/producers, and UI components. Assess the difficulty of adapting these dependencies.Potential Ripple Effects (NFRs &amp; Systemic Qualities): Analyze impacts quantitatively or qualitatively across:Performance: Baseline key metrics (latency percentiles, throughput, resource utilization). Estimate potential changes and define performance testing requirements.Security: Analyze changes to attack surface, potential introduction/mitigation of specific CWEs, impact on authentication/authorization/encryption, data privacy/residency implications. Define security validation requirements (threat modeling, pen testing).Reliability: Analyze impact on failure modes, error handling, fault tolerance mechanisms, MTBF/MTTR. Define reliability testing needs (e.g., chaos engineering experiments).Maintainability: Code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity), readability, testability, ease of debugging, adherence to coding standards.Operability: Impact on deployment frequency/safety, monitoring effectiveness, logging usefulness, ease of troubleshooting, configuration management complexity.Usability: Add examples of specific usability considerations, such as: ‘Will the refactoring introduce any changes to user workflows? Will it require updates to user documentation or training materials?’ Potential changes to user workflows or interfaces, even if unintentional.Specify the required output format for this analysis to enable clear prioritization and risk assessment. For example: ‘Generate a detailed, sortable, and filterable table listing each affected component (precise identifier), its type, the specific nature of impact, a detailed description of change/interaction, estimated complexity (e.g., Fibonacci scale), likelihood of impact occurring (Low/Med/High), potential severity if impact occurs (Low/Med/High), detectability (Easy/Med/Hard), proposed priority (P1-P4), confidence level of this assessment (Low/Med/High), and initial thoughts on mitigation difficulty.’Generate a Comprehensive, Strategic, Economic, and Actionable Refactoring Plan Document:Strategic Program Blueprint: Construct a detailed, well-organized document titled “Refactoring Plan”. Emphasize its role as the definitive blueprint, central communication artifact, economic justification, risk management framework, and living guide for a potentially long-running, multi-team initiative.Strategic Goals (SMART, Aligned, Measured): Clearly articulate the primary Goals, ensuring they are SMART, directly linked to business OKRs/KPIs and technical strategy (e.g., specific architectural principles, quality attribute targets based on ISO 25010). Define both leading indicators (predicting success during the program) and lagging indicators (measuring success after completion). Add more specific examples of leading and lagging indicators. For example: ‘Leading indicators: % of code refactored, test coverage of refactored code, number of critical vulnerabilities identified and fixed. Lagging indicators: reduction in bug reports, improvement in deployment frequency, reduction in mean time to recovery (MTTR), increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS) due to improved system reliability.’Compelling Rationale &amp; Economic Justification: Provide a robust, data-driven Rationale. Include a formal Cost-Benefit Analysis section: estimate total costs (developer effort, infrastructure changes, tooling, training, potential disruption/downtime, opportunity cost) versus quantifiable benefits (reduced maintenance costs, increased development velocity, improved performance/reliability leading to revenue/retention gains, new market capabilities enabled, specific risk reduction). Calculate estimated ROI or payback period where feasible. Justify the effort against concrete alternatives with their own cost/benefit profiles. Use metrics (code churn, bug density, complexity scores, lead time for changes) to quantify the “cost of inaction.”Granular, Phased Technical Approach (Patterns, Strategies, Observability): Describe the proposed technical Approach in extensive, granular detail, likely broken into distinct phases or workstreams. Outline sequences, specific patterns, algorithms, architectural changes, data handling/migration strategies, and crucially, the observability strategy during the refactoring. Explicitly detail:Preparatory Steps: E.g., enhancing test coverage to a specific target percentage, establishing detailed baseline performance/reliability metrics, setting up required infrastructure/tooling/environments, performing necessary dependency upgrades first, creating Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for key choices.Core Refactoring Steps: Break down major transformations into smaller, verifiable sub-steps. Detail strategies for complex scenarios like database schema evolution (zero-downtime techniques like expand/contract, parallel run with feature flags, trigger-based synchronization), monolith decomposition (Strangler Fig implementation, anti-corruption layers, event-driven decoupling patterns, API gateway integration), managing parallel refactoring efforts across teams (defining clear interfaces, integration points, coordination mechanisms).API Versioning Strategy: Define how APIs will be versioned and managed during the transition to minimize disruption for consumers.Feature Flag Strategy: Detail implementation, rollout strategy (canary, blue-green, percentage-based), A/B testing capabilities if applicable, robust monitoring of flag impact, and rigorous flag cleanup process/timeline.Observability Plan: Define specific metrics, logs, and traces needed to monitor the health, performance, and correctness of both old and new code paths during the transition. Specify required dashboards and alerting.Integration &amp; Verification: Define branching strategy (potentially long-lived release branches for large efforts), CI/CD pipeline adaptations (e.g., parallel pipelines, environment promotion strategy), incremental integration points, and rigorous verification at each stage (automated tests, code reviews, architectural reviews, manual checks).Post-Refactoring Cleanup &amp; Handover: Detail steps for decommissioning old code/flags/infrastructure, updating all relevant documentation comprehensively, final end-to-end validation, knowledge transfer to operations/support teams, and potentially a post-mortem analysis.Data Migration Strategy: Add more detail on how to handle potential data migration challenges. For example: ‘If the refactoring involves changes to the database schema, provide a detailed migration plan, including data validation, rollback procedures, and potential downtime considerations. Consider different migration strategies, such as blue-green deployments or online schema changes.’ Provide a detailed plan for data migration if needed, including validation, rollback, and potential downtime considerations.Elaborate significantly and proactively on potential Risks, brainstorming exhaustively and realistically across categories (Technical, Process, Organizational, Financial, Security, Compliance, External Dependencies). Include complex risks like cascading failures during transition, data corruption undetected for periods, long-running branch divergence hell, team burnout/attrition, knowledge silos hindering progress, configuration drift across complex environments, regulatory/compliance violations introduced, or critical third-party dependencies failing.For each significant identified risk, propose concrete, practical, verifiable, and potentially layered Mitigation Strategies. Include advanced techniques where appropriate: rigorous code reviews (consider checklists), pair/mob programming, comprehensive automated testing pyramid (unit, integration, component, contract, E2E, performance, security scanning, mutation testing) with specific coverage/quality goals, feature flags/toggles, canary releases/blue-green deployments with fine-grained monitoring and automated rollback triggers, dedicated integration/staging environments mirroring production, chaos engineering principles to test resilience, frequent small commits/pushes integrated via robust CI/CD with automated quality gates, automated rollback capabilities (code/config/data), comprehensive data backup/validation/restore drills, formal ADRs for critical decisions, regular stakeholder demos and transparent progress reporting, very clear Definition of Done, external security audits/pen-testing, dedicated refactoring teams or protected time, formal knowledge sharing mechanisms, and potentially architectural fitness functions. Expand on the concept of architectural fitness functions. For example: ‘Define specific architectural fitness functions (automated tests that measure architectural qualities like performance, security, and maintainability) to ensure the refactoring doesn’t degrade the overall architecture. These functions should be continuously monitored throughout the refactoring process.’Include Comprehensive, Detailed Dedicated Sections:Multi-Level Testing Strategy: Define scope, goals, tools, environments, responsibilities, test data management (generation/masking/subsetting), and acceptance criteria for each relevant testing level (unit, integration, component, contract, API, E2E, UAT, performance, load, stress, security, usability, accessibility, disaster recovery, rollback). Include strategy for maintaining test suites during heavy code churn. Add exploratory testing charters.Robust, Validated Rollback Plan: Define precise quantitative triggers for rollback, detailed step-by-step procedures (automated where possible) for reverting code/config/data across all affected systems, validation procedures post-rollback, communication plan during rollback execution, and plan for post-rollback root cause analysis.Integrated Security Validation Plan: Outline when (design, implementation, testing, deployment), how (SAST, DAST, IAST, SCA, manual code review, pen-testing, threat modeling updates, compliance checks), and by whom security will be assessed. Define specific security acceptance criteria and processes for handling identified vulnerabilities.Stakeholder Communication Plan &amp; Matrix: Add a section on ‘Communication and Collaboration Strategy’. This section should detail how the refactoring effort will be communicated to stakeholders, how collaboration will be facilitated between teams, and how conflicts will be resolved. This is crucial for large-scale refactoring projects.Example:’Communication and Collaboration Strategy: Define a clear communication and collaboration strategy to ensure all stakeholders are informed and aligned.Stakeholder Identification and Analysis: Identify all stakeholders (internal and external) and their needs.Communication Channels and Frequency: Define communication channels (e.g., regular meetings, email updates, shared documentation) and frequency for each stakeholder group.Collaboration Mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for collaboration between teams (e.g., shared repositories, communication tools, joint workshops).Conflict Resolution Process: Define a process for resolving conflicts that may arise during the refactoring effort.’Resource Allocation, Skills &amp; Budget: Identify teams/individuals, required skills (include skill gap analysis and training plan if needed), dependencies on shared resources/platforms, detailed effort estimation (e.g., using multiple techniques), realistic timeline with phases/milestones/buffers, and allocated budget.Rigorous Definition of Done (DoD): Define specific, verifiable, agreed-upon criteria for program completion. Provide concrete acceptance conditions and how they will be verified and signed off by specific roles (e.g., Architect, Security Officer, Product Owner, SRE Lead, Business Sponsor).Define the Scope Explicitly, Rigorously, Defensively, Collaboratively, and Visually:Contractual &amp; Visual Scope Section: Integrate a distinct, unambiguous “Scope” section. Explicitly state its purpose as a contract. Use visualization techniques (e.g., architectural diagrams, context maps based on Domain-Driven Design principles) to clearly delineate boundaries.Precise In-Scope Definition: List precisely all artifacts in scope, using unambiguous identifiers. Clearly state the intended change type.Aggressive &amp; Justified Out-of-Scope Definition: Explicitly, extensively, and proactively list anything out of scope, providing the rationale for each exclusion to prevent ambiguity and manage expectations.Formal Scope Change Control Process: Detail the formal process for handling scope change requests, including impact assessment (effort, timeline, risk, cost, dependencies), approval workflow, and integration with program governance and delivery cadences (e.g., sprint planning, PI planning).Identify, Characterize, Justify, Track, and Analyze the Preliminary Change Set:Initial Footprint Prediction &amp; Justification: Compile the preliminary Change Set list based on analysis/scope. Justify the prediction.Categorization, Utility &amp; Tracking: Categorize files clearly. Explain utility for tracking, reviews, CI/CD, parallel work planning. Discuss linking files to work items/tickets. Analyze the set for potential hotspots (frequently changed files needing extra coordination) or impacts on build/deployment infrastructure. Consider using this to inform static analysis rule configurations during the refactoring.Purpose, Limitations &amp; Evolution: Emphasize this is a preliminary estimate expected to evolve. Stress the importance of tracking the actual change set against this baseline to identify scope drift or unexpected impacts early.Embed Iterative Refinement, Continuous Feedback, and Adaptive Governance:Living Document &amp; Governance: Conclude the plan by stating it’s a living document governed by the defined change control process.Review Checkpoints &amp; Cadence: Recommend specific checkpoints, review gates, or cadences (e.g., end-of-phase reviews, quarterly program reviews) where the plan’s validity, assumptions, risks, scope, timeline, and budget are formally reassessed and adapted based on learnings and evolving context.Feedback Loop &amp; Metrics: Emphasize incorporating feedback from retrospectives (specifically focused on the refactoring process), code reviews, testing, monitoring data, and stakeholder input. Define leading metrics to track if the plan is on course before major milestones are missed.Generate a program plan that embodies exceptional thoroughness, strategic alignment, economic awareness, proactive risk management, actionable detail, and adaptive governance, thereby maximizing the probability of a successful, predictable, and high-value enterprise-scale refactoring initiative.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Matthias Steiner lift</title><link href="https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Matthias Steiner lift" /><published>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T08:36:45+00:00</updated><id>https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift/"><![CDATA[<video controls="">

  <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> You install Ventoy onto the external drive once. It creates boot partitions and leaves the remaining space as a large data partition (usually exFAT or NTFS). You then simply copy your OS installer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.iso</code> files, WinPE images (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.iso</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.wim</code>), and even full Windows installations packaged in virtual hard disk files (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhd</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhdx</code>) onto this data partition. When you boot from the Ventoy drive, it scans the data partition and presents a menu listing all compatible files, allowing you to boot directly from them.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Extremely easy to set up and manage – just copy/delete files to add/remove OS options.</li>
      <li>No complex manual partitioning required for each OS.</li>
      <li>Excellent compatibility with UEFI (including Secure Boot) and Legacy BIOS modes.</li>
      <li>Supports a wide variety of image types (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.iso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.wim</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.img</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vhd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vhdx</code>).</li>
      <li>Supports persistence for many Linux live ISOs (saving changes across boots, requires creating a persistence file).</li>
      <li>Can directly boot full Windows installations from VHD(x) files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Slight boot overhead compared to a direct installation (usually negligible).</li>
      <li>Performance of OSs running from VHD(x) depends on the VHD type (fixed vs. dynamic), the underlying drive speed, and the USB connection.</li>
      <li>While compatibility is high, rare niche ISOs might have issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Setup Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Ventoy tool from the official website.</li>
      <li>Run the tool and install Ventoy onto your 1TB external HDD (this will erase the drive initially!). Choose the desired partition scheme (MBR for legacy, GPT for UEFI recommended).</li>
      <li>Once Ventoy is installed, the drive will appear with a large partition. Copy your desired files onto this partition:
        <ul>
          <li>Linux ISOs (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubuntu-lts.iso</code>)</li>
          <li>Windows Installer ISOs (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows11.iso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows81.iso</code>)</li>
          <li>WinPE ISOs or WIMs.</li>
          <li><strong>For full Windows installs (Win 11/8.1 To Go style):</strong> Create a VHD(x) file first:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Method A (Recommended): Install directly to VHD:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disk Management</code> (diskmgmt.msc) in Windows to create a new VHD(x) file (choose VHDX, Fixed size for better performance, allocate sufficient space like 64GB+).</li>
                  <li>Attach the created VHD(x) file in Disk Management (it will appear as a new uninitialized disk). Initialize it (GPT recommended) and create a simple volume (format NTFS).</li>
                  <li>Boot your computer using a standard Windows Installer USB/ISO (you can even boot the Windows ISO via Ventoy itself).</li>
                  <li>At the “Where do you want to install Windows?” screen, press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift+F10</code> to open Command Prompt. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diskpart</code> commands to list volumes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list volume</code>) identify the drive letter of your attached VHD, and select the correct partition.</li>
                  <li>Proceed with the installation, selecting the partition on the attached VHD as the target.</li>
                  <li>After installation completes <em>inside the VHD</em>, detach the VHD in Disk Management.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Method B (Capture Existing):</strong> Use a tool like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disk2vhd</code> (from Microsoft Sysinternals) to capture an existing Windows installation into a VHD(x) file.</li>
              <li>Copy the final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhdx</code> file onto the Ventoy data partition.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Safely eject the drive. Boot your target computer from the USB drive. Ventoy’s menu should appear, allowing you to select and boot your desired OS image or VHD.</li>
    </ol>

  <li>Save the timer file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/system/backup-opensuse.timer</code></li>
  <li>Enable and start the timer:

<h2 id="1-understanding-nginx-unit-in-directadmin">1. Understanding Nginx Unit in DirectAdmin</h2>

<p>DirectAdmin integrates Nginx Unit as a polyglot application server that supports multiple languages and their versions. According to the <a href="https://docs.directadmin.com/webservices/nginx_unit/">DirectAdmin documentation</a>, you can access Nginx Unit functionality through:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="2-creating-a-flask-application-structure">2. Creating a Flask Application Structure</h2>

<p>Let’s create a production-ready Flask application structure:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/static
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/templates
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/models
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/views
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/logs
<span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> /home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/instance
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure follows Flask best practices with separation of concerns and a dedicated instance folder for configuration files that shouldn’t be in version control.</p>

<h2 id="9-enhanced-security-with-filesystem-isolation">9. Enhanced Security with Filesystem Isolation</h2>

<p>Nginx Unit provides filesystem isolation via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rootfs</code> option. This feature restricts your application’s access to only the specified directory, enhancing security.</p>

<p>While the DirectAdmin UI may not expose all isolation options directly, you can update the configuration using the API. Here’s an example of how to add filesystem isolation:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">-X</span> PUT <span class="nt">--unix-socket</span> /var/run/unit/control.sock <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s1">'{
    "isolation": {
      "rootfs": "/home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app",
      "namespaces": {
        "mount": true
      }
    }
  }'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  http://localhost/config/applications/flask_app/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">namespaces.mount</code> set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> enhances security by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pivot_root</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chroot</code>, preventing common chroot escape techniques.</p>

<h2 id="10-creating-route-in-directadmin-ui">10. Creating Route in DirectAdmin UI</h2>

<ol>
  <li>From the Nginx Unit page, click <strong>Create Route</strong></li>
  <li>Fill in the following details:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Domain</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example.com</code></li>
      <li><strong>Application</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flask_app</code></li>
      <li><strong>Add Static Files Route</strong>: Check this option</li>
      <li><strong>Static Files Path</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/username/domains/example.com/public_html/flask_app/app/static</code></li>
      <li><strong>Static Files URI</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/static/*</code></li>
