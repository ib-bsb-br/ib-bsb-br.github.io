This plan focuses on using the shared host’s features such as unlimited bandwidth, multiple websites/subdomains, and daily backups, ensuring you get the most out of your hosting package.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</p>

<p>Use the Shared Host for Your Primary Websites ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • With 5 websites hosted and 50 subdomains available, you can run several independent web projects under your plan. Take advantage of unlimited bandwidth and daily backups to keep your main sites safe and always online.
• Deploy small- to medium-scale applications or static websites without worrying about traffic spikes—your plan includes unlimited bandwidth.
• The included SSL certificates and built-in security tools (Advanced DDoS Protection, Antivirus/Antimalware, Web Application Firewall) can shield your public-facing content from common attacks, reducing the need for heavy security measures on your end.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 2) Subdomains for Organization and Separation ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Create subdomains for each distinct service or section of your website(s). For example: – blog.example.com
– forum.example.com
– dev.example.com
• Each subdomain gets its own directory and can be configured to use different PHP versions, thanks to the control panel’s “Multiple Hardened Versions” feature.
• This structure helps you organize projects, test new features, and maintain better security assurances—an issue in one subdomain (like a rogue plugin) is less likely to affect others.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 3) Leverage Integrated Tools in DirectAdmin ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Use “Custom Cronjobs” to schedule periodic tasks—like clearing caches, running backups, or performing routine maintenance scripts—directly on your shared host.
• The “Enriched App Installer” can quickly deploy CMSs like WordPress, Joomla, or eCommerce platforms. This helps you set up and maintain various sites quickly and with minimal fuss.
• The daily and weekly remote backups (2,000+ km away) offer a solid data safety net. Even if your main data center experiences issues, you can restore from older snapshots with Jetbackup tools in DirectAdmin.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 4) Enable Security and Performance Features ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • DDoS Protection and the Web Application Firewall (WAF) guard your sites at the network and application layers.
• Commercial antivirus and antimalware solutions in your hosting environment scan uploaded files (e.g., attachments or user-submitted content) for known threats.
• Choose the latest available hardened PHP version under DirectAdmin for best performance and security fixes.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 5) Integrating Your Home Debian Server ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── While you might rely primarily on your shared hosting, there are still good reasons to tap into a dedicated Debian environment at home:</p>

<p>5a) Offload Resource-Intensive Tasks
• Any CPU-, RAM-, or disk-intensive operations—like large-scale data processing, video encoding, or container-based apps—can be handled on your Debian machine, freeing the shared environment for front-end operations.
• Keep routine resource-heavy cronjobs or background tasks running locally on Debian to avoid hitting any resource cap on the shared host.</p>

<p>5b) Custom Software or Services
• If you want to experiment with technologies not supported by the shared host (e.g., Docker, Incus, specialized databases), do so on Debian.
• Accessible endpoints on your Debian machine can be integrated into your main site via subdomain (api.mysite.com) or direct script calls. Note you’ll need to set up dynamic DNS or a static IP, plus port forwarding on your router.</p>

<p>5c) Reverse Proxy or Direct Subdomain Linking
• If feasible, configure your shared host’s Nginx (via DirectAdmin’s custom config) to proxy certain paths to your Debian server so users never leave the main domain. Example:</p>

<p>location /backend-service/ { proxy_pass https://your-debian-ip-or-ddns/; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_redirect off; }</p>

<p>• Otherwise, create a subdomain (e.g., backend.example.com) and point its DNS record to your home server’s public IP or dynamic DNS address.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 6) Content Synchronization and Backups ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Thanks to unlimited bandwidth, you can schedule direct or automated backups from the shared host down to your Debian server—providing an extra layer of redundancy beyond the host’s remote backups.
• If you store large files or media on Debian, you can sync them with the shared host (via rsync or FTP) so front-end site visitors get fast downloads without taxing your home upload speeds too heavily.
• Combining daily backups from the host and additional local backups on Debian helps ensure multiple restoration points in case of data corruption or an attack.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 7) Security and Maintenance Considerations ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Keep an eye on physical memory usage (2 GB limit) and inodes (250,000) on the shared host, especially if you plan on hosting multiple sites with heavy content.
• Regularly check logs and resource stats in DirectAdmin to ensure you’re not running up against memory constraints or hitting any hidden throttling.
• Keep your Debian machine patched and secured (firewall rules, fail2ban) if it’s exposed to the internet. If you have a dynamic IP, consider a stable dynamic DNS approach and SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt) for any subdomains or direct connections.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 8) Conclusion ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── With “Webmaster Mini,” you can comfortably host multiple sites with generous bandwidth, daily remote backups, and a suite of security measures—perfect for small businesses, blogs, or personal projects. Subdomains and DirectAdmin’s integrated tools let you centralize services on the paid hosting environment.
Your Debian home server then becomes a complementary powerhouse, tackling specialized tasks, providing custom software stacks, and acting as a secondary backup location. By focusing your main site(s) and web presence on the robust features of the shared host, you maximize performance and security, while still harnessing the flexibility of a personal Linux environment for advanced or resource-intensive workloads.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Overclocking your Raspberry Pi 3B</title><link href="https://ib.bsb.br/overclocking-your-raspberry-pi-3b/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Overclocking your Raspberry Pi 3B" /><published>2025-02-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-23T10:14:26+00:00</updated><id>https://ib.bsb.br/overclocking-your-raspberry-pi-3b</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ib.bsb.br/overclocking-your-raspberry-pi-3b/"><![CDATA[<p>Overclocking your Raspberry Pi 3B is done by editing its configuration file so that the system boots with higher-than-standard clock settings. However, please note that overclocking can lead to instability, increased temperatures, and might void your warranty. Ensure you have adequate cooling (a good heatsink and possibly a fan) and monitor your Pi’s temperature (using a tool like vcgencmd measure_temp) after making changes.</p>

<p>Here’s how to overclock your Pi:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Back Up Your Data<br />
 • Before making any changes, back up your important data in case the system becomes unstable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit the Configuration File<br />
 • Open a terminal.<br />
 • Edit the file /boot/config.txt with your favorite text editor (e.g., nano):<br />
  sudo nano /boot/config.txt<br />
 • Scroll down (or add at the end) to include the overclocking settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add Overclocking Parameters<br />
For a Raspberry Pi 3B, users commonly experiment with settings like the following. (Your mileage may vary; if you experience instability, dial back the settings.) For example, you might add:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>  # Overclock settings for Raspberry Pi 3B<br />
  arm_freq=1400<br />
  core_freq=500<br />
  over_voltage=6</p>

<p>• arm_freq increases the CPU frequency (the default for the Pi 3B is 1200 MHz).<br />
• core_freq sets the GPU’s “core” clock frequency.<br />
• over_voltage helps stabilize the overclock at higher speeds by increasing the voltage (even a small increase may be needed).<br />
  Note: Some users also add force_turbo=1 to keep the CPU running at maximum speed at all times, but doing so may lead to higher power consumption and additional heat and can void warranty claims regarding performance.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Save and Reboot<br />
 • Save your changes (in nano, press Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X).<br />
 • Reboot your Raspberry Pi:<br />
  sudo reboot</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test Stability and Monitor Temperature<br />
 • After rebooting, test your system. If you encounter crashes or unusual behavior, reduce the overclock settings (lower arm_freq or lower over_voltage) until you find stable values.<br />
 • Monitor temperature with:<br />
  vcgencmd measure_temp<br />
  and consider additional cooling if temperatures are high.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Customize as Needed<br />
Since you’re running X11 with ratpoison as your window manager, note that these overclock settings affect the entire system, not just the graphical environment. Fine-tune based on your performance needs and stability.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, every Raspberry Pi’s silicon and cooling solution may behave differently with overclocking, so it’s important to experiment incrementally and carefully. Enjoy the extra performance, but always keep an eye on system stability and temperature!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Overclocking on a Raspberry Pi 3B is done by editing the boot configuration file (config.txt) on the SD card. However, there are a few important notes and cautions:

1) Overclocking can void warranties (especially if you enable force_turbo=1).  
2) Each individual board behaves differently; some might not be stable at higher frequencies.  
3) Ensure you have adequate power (5V at 2.5–3A) and cooling (heatsinks, fan) to manage extra heat.  
4) There is no official “Overclock” option in raspi-config for Pi 3B—overclocking must be done manually.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP-BY-STEP: Edit config.txt
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Open /boot/config.txt in a text editor:
   sudo nano /boot/config.txt

2. Add or modify lines for overclocking; for example:
   over_voltage=4
   arm_freq=1350
   gpu_freq=400
   #force_turbo=1

   • over_voltage sets how much extra voltage to supply to the CPU (range 0–6). Each step of 1 = +0.025 V. 4 is a moderate increase.  
   • arm_freq sets CPU frequency (in MHz). 1350–1400 MHz is common for mild to moderate overclocks on Pi 3B.  
   • gpu_freq sets the GPU core frequency (in MHz). Typical values range ~300–400 MHz.  
   • force_turbo=1 forces the CPU/GPU to run at the specified frequencies even when idle (voids warranty).  

3. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

4. Reboot to apply changes:
   sudo reboot

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Monitoring Temperature &amp; Stability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Check temperature:
  vcgencmd measure_temp
  – Aim to keep under ~70–80°C under load.  

• Check CPU frequency:
  watch -n 1 cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
  – Updates every second to see if you’re hitting your target clock.  

• Watch for undervoltage or throttling warnings in:
  dmesg | grep -i volt
  – If you see undervoltage warnings, ensure your power supply can deliver stable 5V 2.5A+.

If the system becomes unstable (freezes, unexpected reboots), either reduce frequency or increase over_voltage slightly. Always keep an eye on temperatures and stability. Each Pi board’s “safe” overclock margin can vary.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tips
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Use a proper heat sink (or a heat sink + fan) to keep CPU/GPU cool.  
• Start with small increments for arm_freq (e.g., go from 1200 to 1250, 1300, etc.) and test.  
• If you need a bit more stability at higher clocks, gradually raise over_voltage (not recommended to exceed 6).  
• force_turbo=1 locks the CPU at full speed, but it will void your warranty “bit” in the OTP memory. Consider leaving it off unless you need constant high performance.  

That’s it! With the config.txt approach, you can manually tune your Raspberry Pi 3B for a stable overclock in your X11 + ratpoison environment.

It is designed to be efficient and fast, providing a simple, keyboard-driven interface with no unnecessary decorations or features. It doesn’t rely on external libraries and allows for efficient window management. Although the lack of a traditional desktop environment might feel unusual at first, users find that it increases productivity by minimizing the need for window resizing, opening, or hiding.</p>

<p>For an even more streamlined experience, Ratpoison includes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code> script. This script enables multiple desktops, making it easier to organize and switch between tasks. Using multiple desktops in Ratpoison can be particularly useful when working with multiple documents or tasks simultaneously.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-rpws-for-desktop-switching">Setting Up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code> for Desktop Switching</h2>

<p>To configure desktop switching with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code>, you will need to add the following line to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ratpoisonrc</code> file:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">exec </span>rpws init N <span class="nt">-k</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> is the number of desktops you wish to create (at least 2). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-k</code> flag is optional and is only necessary if you want to use predefined keybindings for switching desktops and managing windows.</p>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code> is initialized, it will create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> desktops, and by default, it assigns the following keybindings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt+F(N)</code> - Switch to desktop <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt+F1</code> switches to the first desktop).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+Right</code> - Go to the next desktop.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+Left</code> - Go to the previous desktop.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+Windows+F(N)</code> - Move the current window to desktop <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+&gt;</code> - Move the window to the next desktop.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+&lt;</code> - Move the window to the previous desktop.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you may find these keybindings inconvenient or difficult to use. In that case, you can customize them to suit your preferences.</p>

<h2 id="customizing-rpws-hotkeys">Customizing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code> Hotkeys</h2>

This approach maximizes the value of your paid shared host and keeps the home server in a supporting role.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Prioritize the Shared Host’s Role ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Since you’ve invested in a shared host, make it the command center for all your core web capabilities:
1a) Main Website and Landing Page
• Use the shared host’s DirectAdmin interface for your public-facing site(s).
• Take advantage of any “one-click” installs or website builders (WordPress, Joomla, etc.) if you want to speed up deployment.
• Store and serve your main site’s static files, images, and downloads directly from the shared host to benefit from its potentially faster CDN or caching features.
1b) Domain Management
• Let the shared host control the primary DNS settings (DNS zones, subdomains, email routing).
• This centralizes your domain’s management, meaning you’ll make all domain-related changes in one place.
• Ensure you have SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt or others) actively set up for both your main domain and any subdomains you create.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 2) Extending the Shared Host with Subdomains ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Because the shared host serves as your primary environment, you can extend its capabilities by creating multiple subdomains. Each subdomain can be configured within DirectAdmin, making it easy to keep different projects organized under one account:
2a) Subdomain Setup in DirectAdmin
• Log in to DirectAdmin → Domain Setup → Create Subdomain. (e.g., dev.yourdomain.com, api.yourdomain.com)
• Once created, each subdomain can be managed like a mini-site: you can assign docroot folders, SSL certificates, and custom Nginx directives (if allowed).
2b) File and Application Organization
• Keep each subdomain’s code or files in its own directory. This ensures you can maintain updates and security patches independently.
• If your shared host allows multiple PHP versions, you can assign different versions to each subdomain for compatibility with varied apps.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 3) Integrating the Debian Home Server ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── While the shared host will do most of the heavy lifting, you can still harness your Debian server to handle tasks the shared environment may not permit:
3a) Specialized Services or Background Jobs
• Use the Debian server for applications requiring root access, custom packages, or kernel-level tweaks (e.g., Docker/Incus-based containers, custom VPN, advanced caching).
• Run periodic or resource-intensive jobs (like continuous data processing) that you’d rather not burden your shared host with.
3b) Direct Interaction with the Shared Host
• If you need your Debian server to collect data from or send data to the main site, use secure APIs or scheduled tasks (cron + SSH or scp).
• Your shared host can regularly trigger a URL on the Debian server (via a cron job or webhooks) to run specialized scripts or queue tasks.
3c) DNS Configuration for Subdomains (Optional)
• For a subdomain that must point to your Debian server (e.g., specializedapp.yourdomain.com), create an A or CNAME record in your shared host’s DNS panel that sends traffic directly to the Debian server’s IP.
• Protect any publicly accessible service on Debian with Let’s Encrypt certificates and firewall rules.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 4) Advanced Reverse Proxy Strategy ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── If your shared host allows custom Nginx configurations, you can keep a single domain (e.g., example.com) and proxy certain paths to your Debian server:
4a) Confirm with Hosting Provider
• Verify you’re permitted to modify or request changes to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or includes in DirectAdmin.
• Ask if you can insert custom “location” directives for proxying traffic.
4b) Set Up Nginx Proxy
• Within the DirectAdmin custom Nginx config area, add something like:
location /special-app/ { proxy_pass https:///; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_redirect off; }
• This approach hides the fact that the service is running elsewhere—visitors remain on example.com while certain requests are silently forwarded to your Debian server.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 5) Security and Maintenance ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 5a) Shared Host Security
• Keep your shared host’s software updated. Ensure any DirectAdmin auto-installers or scripts are patched.
• Enable HTTPS for every domain and subdomain.
• Use strong passwords for DirectAdmin and SFTP.
5b) Debian Server Hardening
• If you open any ports (HTTP/HTTPS) to the public, install fail2ban or use ufw/iptables to guard against malicious traffic.
• Keep Debian patched (sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y).
5c) Monitoring and Backups
• Use the shared host’s built-in backup tools for your main site.
• Mirror critical backups to your Debian server for offsite redundancy (e.g., a cron job that scp’s daily backups from the shared host to Debian).
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 6) Ongoing Optimization ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Evaluate which tasks can be offloaded to your home server if they become too resource-intensive for shared hosting (e.g., advanced analytics, large file conversions).
• Check your hosting package for “unlimited” resources (with a fair usage policy) and see if you can leverage advanced caching, staging sites, or installed modules.
• Keep an eye on performance metrics—if your site’s load times or concurrency needs outgrow what the shared host provides, you may eventually consider upgrading to a VPS or dedicated plan.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Conclusion ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── By leveraging the DirectAdmin-based shared environment as your primary and most visible platform, you maximize the hosting features you’ve already paid for—such as easy domain management, built-in SSL, one-click installs, and standard backups. Meanwhile, your home Debian server acts as a flexible extension, handling tasks that require more freedom or brute force. This strategy balances cost-effectiveness (you’re using what you’ve paid for) with the versatility of a dedicated Linux environment at home." data-download-link="" data-download-link-label="Download Markdown"><code class="language-markdown">Below is a revised step-by-step guide that shifts more responsibility to your shared hosting environment (Nginx + DirectAdmin) while still allowing your Debian home server to handle any specialized or niche tasks. This approach maximizes the value of your paid shared host and keeps the home server in a supporting role.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Prioritize the Shared Host’s Role ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Since you’ve invested in a shared host, make it the command center for all your core web capabilities:
1a) Main Website and Landing Page
• Use the shared host’s DirectAdmin interface for your public-facing site(s).
• Take advantage of any “one-click” installs or website builders (WordPress, Joomla, etc.) if you want to speed up deployment.
• Store and serve your main site’s static files, images, and downloads directly from the shared host to benefit from its potentially faster CDN or caching features.
1b) Domain Management
• Let the shared host control the primary DNS settings (DNS zones, subdomains, email routing).
• This centralizes your domain’s management, meaning you’ll make all domain-related changes in one place.
• Ensure you have SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt or others) actively set up for both your main domain and any subdomains you create.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 2) Extending the Shared Host with Subdomains ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Because the shared host serves as your primary environment, you can extend its capabilities by creating multiple subdomains. Each subdomain can be configured within DirectAdmin, making it easy to keep different projects organized under one account:
2a) Subdomain Setup in DirectAdmin
• Log in to DirectAdmin → Domain Setup → Create Subdomain. (e.g., dev.yourdomain.com, api.yourdomain.com)
• Once created, each subdomain can be managed like a mini-site: you can assign docroot folders, SSL certificates, and custom Nginx directives (if allowed).
2b) File and Application Organization
• Keep each subdomain’s code or files in its own directory. This ensures you can maintain updates and security patches independently.
• If your shared host allows multiple PHP versions, you can assign different versions to each subdomain for compatibility with varied apps.

The previous response is quite good, focusing heavily on utilizing the shared hosting environment. However, some areas could be improved for greater clarity and more direct actionable advice. Specifically, the sections dealing with security and offloading tasks from the shared host need more practical tips and context, given the limited resources. Let's focus on enhancing the "offload" scenarios and providing tailored security recommendations within DirectAdmin.
Issues:

The advice in "5b) Custom Software or Services" needs more context. What specific custom apps are a good fit for Debian, and what is the integration path given a beginner with 2 GB RAM on the host?
Reverse proxying still feels optimistic. The response should emphasize checking if it's possible and provide clearer backup steps.
Backups section: Add steps for restoring a backup, should a failure occur in either environment

Assumptions:

The previous response assumes a moderate level of comfort with command-line environments and networking principles.

Structure:

The response follows a logical flow, prioritizing the shared host's capabilities and then integrating the Debian server to handle any tasks the shared environment doesn't permit. 

Prioritized Improvements:
Strengthen the section on selecting appropriate software or services to run on Debian: Provide examples of easy-to-integrate yet powerful services that can be run locally on Debian and linked to the shared host.
Refine the explanation on the reverse proxy approach: *Emphasize a check with the hosting provider before even attempting the process.

Offer clear steps for testing once a reverse proxy is apparently configured.*
Improve advice on restoration after backup: Provide a simplified procedure for restoration, should issues arise in the host or Debian.

Detailed Steps:

Enhance Debian Service Selection: Replace "Custom Software or Services" with "Ideal Debian Services (with Limited Shared Host Resources)". Provide examples like:

"PrivateBin": A self-hosted pastebin.
"tt-rss": A self-hosted RSS feed aggregator.
"syncthing": Peer-to-peer file synchronization.
Emphasize that all of these are relatively light on resources and don't necessarily require extensive database configurations or complicated API integrations. They mostly just serve content.
Explain a simple use case: "You can use PrivateBin on your Debian server to store sensitive information, which is then linked to from the shared host, where you can't store sensitive text files due to shared server concerns."
Revise Reverse Proxying: Rephrase the reverse proxy section to be more cautionary.

Start with: "Before you even begin, contact your hosting provider. Ask if they allow any custom reverse proxy directives or the inclusion of custom server blocks, and if they have documentation on it."
Add test: "After configuring what appears to be a reverse proxy, create a file on your Debian server and attempt to access it via your shared host. If the attempt produces an error, then a correct reverse proxy is not in place. Check with your provider, or abandon reverse proxy and simply set up a subdomain for access."
Elaborate on Restoring Backups: In "Content Synchronization and Backups," add instructions to each side, indicating how to proceed after a catastrophe, providing restoration steps. This makes the backups more helpful

Tone:

Maintain a friendly and encouraging tone.
Emphasize the experimental and learning aspects of the setup.
Stress that it's perfectly fine if certain features (like reverse proxy) aren't possible, and that the primary goal is to maximize shared hosting while still using the home server for targeted, unique benefits.

Below is a revised guide to maximizing the power of your "Webmaster Mini" shared host with Nginx + DirectAdmin and integrating it thoughtfully with your home Debian server. This approach prioritizes using the features you've paid for and making sure your Debian machine handles what the shared host *cannot*.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Leverage Your Shared Host for Core Web Needs ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Multiple Websites: Take advantage of your 5-website allowance to run various sites – personal blogs, small business pages, portfolios, or landing pages. • High Availability: The unlimited bandwidth means you can have active websites without worrying about overage charges. • Security Center: Your package includes automatic DDoS protection, antivirus, and a web application firewall. Use these tools and ensure they are enabled.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 2) Subdomains as Building Blocks ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Utilize subdomains (you have 50!) for organizational clarity:  blog.example.com ,  docs.example.com , or  store.example.com . • Each subdomain functions as a semi-isolated unit, allowing you to test new themes or apps without impacting the main site. • You can even use different PHP versions on each, ensuring compatibility.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 3) Prioritizing Shared Hosting Integrated Features ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • “One-Click” Installs: Save time and effort using tools available within DirectAdmin like Softaculous/Installatron to quickly deploy applications like WordPress, Joomla, or other CMSs. This means you can quickly and easily deploy web applications. • Daily Backups: The automatic daily and weekly backups offer peace of mind. You can use DirectAdmin to view or restore files should any files get lost or modified.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 4) Ideal Debian Services (with Limited Shared Host Resources) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── If you have specific needs that your shared host doesn't serve, then your Debian machine can be made to fit.

• Important Tip: If your Debian is behind a home router, be sure to set up port forwarding for any publicly accessible services (usually ports 80 and 443). Also consider using a dynamic DNS service (e.g., DuckDNS) if your home IP address changes.

Here are a few examples: PrivateBin: A minimalist, open-source online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data. You can use PrivateBin on your Debian server to store sensitive information that is then linked from the shared host, where you can't store sensitive text files due to shared server concerns.

tt-rss: An open-source RSS feed aggregator. This is an easy way to keep up with the latest news without relying on third-party services. Because it serves content, it can be placed on the Debian server to alleviate load on the host.

syncthing: Peer-to-peer file synchronization. This service can assist in synchronizing files between your shared host and your Debian server if you are unable to find other means of synchronization.

All of these tools are relatively low-impact on memory. You are serving the files from the host, and using your host to link to what the Debian server is serving.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 5) Reverse Proxy: Use with Caution ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Before you even begin, contact your hosting provider. Ask if they allow any custom reverse proxy directives or the inclusion of custom server blocks, and if they have documentation on it. Keep in mind that some providers will not offer support for this type of set up. If not, it is a reasonable idea to simply use a subdomain.

If a reverse proxy is feasible and if you wish to attempt it, you can do so by adding something like the following to your Nginx configuration:

 
location /my-special-app/ {
proxy_pass https://your-debian-ip-or-ddns/;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_redirect off;
}
 

After configuring what appears to be a reverse proxy, create a file on your Debian server and attempt to access it via your shared host. If the attempt produces an error, then a correct reverse proxy is not in place. Check with your provider, or abandon reverse proxy and simply set up a subdomain for access.

A subdomain would entail setting up an A record for subdomain.domain.com, and pointing it at your external IP address. Then you would set up your application on the Debian server to service that subdomain, in Nginx.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 6) Robust Backups are Crucial ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Your host already has a solid backup system. However, you can also backup some key files to Debian:

Manual or Scripted Backups: Use cron jobs to make copies of critical data.

Restoring the backup

On Host: If the shared host suffers a catastrophic error, contact their support for restoration procedures. If you have a script to handle restoration, and are authorized to do so, you may use it instead.
On Debian: If the Debian server suffers a catastrophic error, re-install the operating system and install the desired services. Then restore the files you have backed up to the Debian server.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 7) Security Recommendations ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The shared host has security measurements in place. It is always important to maintain strong passwords, not click suspicious links, and be aware of all security practices on the shared hosting platform. You are sharing the server with other users, which makes this critical.

For Debian, a good first measure would be to disable password authentication, and only allow authentication using a certificate.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This approach assumes a moderate level of comfort with command-line environments and networking principles.

With "Webmaster Mini," you can comfortably host multiple sites with generous bandwidth, daily remote backups, and a suite of security measures—perfect for small businesses, blogs, or personal projects. Subdomains and DirectAdmin’s integrated tools let you centralize services on the paid hosting environment.

Your Debian home server then becomes a complementary powerhouse, tackling specialized tasks, providing custom software stacks, and acting as a secondary backup location. By focusing your main site(s) and web presence on the robust features of the shared host, you maximize performance and security, while still harnessing the flexibility of a personal Linux environment for advanced or resource-intensive workloads. 
```

***

Below is a revised guide that maximizes the capabilities of your “Webmaster Mini” shared host with Nginx + DirectAdmin—while still enabling your home Debian server to provide specialized services when needed. This plan focuses on using the shared host’s features such as unlimited bandwidth, multiple websites/subdomains, and daily backups, ensuring you get the most out of your hosting package.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Use the Shared Host for Your Primary Websites ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • With 5 websites hosted and 50 subdomains available, you can run several independent web projects under your plan. Take advantage of unlimited bandwidth and daily backups to keep your main sites safe and always online.
• Deploy small- to medium-scale applications or static websites without worrying about traffic spikes—your plan includes unlimited bandwidth.
• The included SSL certificates and built-in security tools (Advanced DDoS Protection, Antivirus/Antimalware, Web Application Firewall) can shield your public-facing content from common attacks, reducing the need for heavy security measures on your end.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 2) Subdomains for Organization and Separation ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Create subdomains for each distinct service or section of your website(s). For example: – blog.example.com
– forum.example.com
– dev.example.com
• Each subdomain gets its own directory and can be configured to use different PHP versions, thanks to the control panel’s “Multiple Hardened Versions” feature.
• This structure helps you organize projects, test new features, and maintain better security assurances—an issue in one subdomain (like a rogue plugin) is less likely to affect others.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 3) Leverage Integrated Tools in DirectAdmin ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Use “Custom Cronjobs” to schedule periodic tasks—like clearing caches, running backups, or performing routine maintenance scripts—directly on your shared host.
• The “Enriched App Installer” can quickly deploy CMSs like WordPress, Joomla, or eCommerce platforms. This helps you set up and maintain various sites quickly and with minimal fuss.
• The daily and weekly remote backups (2,000+ km away) offer a solid data safety net. Even if your main data center experiences issues, you can restore from older snapshots with Jetbackup tools in DirectAdmin.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 4) Enable Security and Performance Features ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • DDoS Protection and the Web Application Firewall (WAF) guard your sites at the network and application layers.
• Commercial antivirus and antimalware solutions in your hosting environment scan uploaded files (e.g., attachments or user-submitted content) for known threats.
• Choose the latest available hardened PHP version under DirectAdmin for best performance and security fixes.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 5) Integrating Your Home Debian Server ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── While you might rely primarily on your shared hosting, there are still good reasons to tap into a dedicated Debian environment at home:

5a) Offload Resource-Intensive Tasks
• Any CPU-, RAM-, or disk-intensive operations—like large-scale data processing, video encoding, or container-based apps—can be handled on your Debian machine, freeing the shared environment for front-end operations.
• Keep routine resource-heavy cronjobs or background tasks running locally on Debian to avoid hitting any resource cap on the shared host.

5b) Custom Software or Services
• If you want to experiment with technologies not supported by the shared host (e.g., Docker, Incus, specialized databases), do so on Debian.
• Accessible endpoints on your Debian machine can be integrated into your main site via subdomain (api.mysite.com) or direct script calls. Note you’ll need to set up dynamic DNS or a static IP, plus port forwarding on your router.

5c) Reverse Proxy or Direct Subdomain Linking
• If feasible, configure your shared host’s Nginx (via DirectAdmin’s custom config) to proxy certain paths to your Debian server so users never leave the main domain. Example:

location /backend-service/ { proxy_pass https://your-debian-ip-or-ddns/; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_redirect off; }

• Otherwise, create a subdomain (e.g., backend.example.com) and point its DNS record to your home server’s public IP or dynamic DNS address.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 6) Content Synchronization and Backups ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Thanks to unlimited bandwidth, you can schedule direct or automated backups from the shared host down to your Debian server—providing an extra layer of redundancy beyond the host’s remote backups.
• If you store large files or media on Debian, you can sync them with the shared host (via rsync or FTP) so front-end site visitors get fast downloads without taxing your home upload speeds too heavily.
• Combining daily backups from the host and additional local backups on Debian helps ensure multiple restoration points in case of data corruption or an attack.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 7) Security and Maintenance Considerations ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── • Keep an eye on physical memory usage (2 GB limit) and inodes (250,000) on the shared host, especially if you plan on hosting multiple sites with heavy content.
• Regularly check logs and resource stats in DirectAdmin to ensure you’re not running up against memory constraints or hitting any hidden throttling.
• Keep your Debian machine patched and secured (firewall rules, fail2ban) if it’s exposed to the internet. If you have a dynamic IP, consider a stable dynamic DNS approach and SSL certificates (Let’s Encrypt) for any subdomains or direct connections.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 8) Conclusion ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── With “Webmaster Mini,” you can comfortably host multiple sites with generous bandwidth, daily remote backups, and a suite of security measures—perfect for small businesses, blogs, or personal projects. Subdomains and DirectAdmin’s integrated tools let you centralize services on the paid hosting environment.
Your Debian home server then becomes a complementary powerhouse, tackling specialized tasks, providing custom software stacks, and acting as a secondary backup location. By focusing your main site(s) and web presence on the robust features of the shared host, you maximize performance and security, while still harnessing the flexibility of a personal Linux environment for advanced or resource-intensive workloads.

<p>2025 marks nearly 20 years since the introduction of Windows’ current DRM system, the Software Protection Platform (SPP). With it serving as the primary gateway to activation since <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_Vista_build_5212_(winmain)">early in Windows Vista’s development</a>, many have come up with clever ways of tricking it, from <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/activate-64-bit-windows-vista-ultimate-and-x64-with-timerstop-v2a-crack-plus-2099-trick/">resetting grace period timers</a> to <a href="https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/kmsemulator-kms-client-and-server-emulation-source.41010/">emulating KMS servers</a> to <a href="https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/windows-loader-download.58464/">hooking bootloaders</a>. While all of these systems abuse various activation methods, there has never been an exploit that directly attacked SPP itself… until now.</p>

<!-- truncate -->

<p>In this blogpost, we introduce <a href="https://github.com/massgravel/TSforge">TSforge</a>, one of our most powerful activation exploits ever. Capable of activating every edition of every version of Windows since Windows 7, as well as every Windows addon and Office version since Office 2013, TSforge is both the most complex and most wide-reaching exploit we’ve implemented in MAS to date, rivaled only by our ill-fated <a href="https://massgrave.dev/blog/keyhole">Keyhole</a> exploit. Aside from discussing how TSforge works, I’ll also be discussing the wild path we took to discover and understand it, as well as some of the fun things we did with it along the way.</p>

<h2 id="spp">SPP</h2>

<p>SPP is a very complex system with several moving parts involved. To keep things simple, we’ll only focus on the parts relevant to this exploit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sppsvc.exe</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slsvc.exe</code> - The primary usermode service for SPP, responsible for managing licenses and activation statuses</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spsys.sys</code> - (Windows Vista/7 only) Responsible for storing sensitive activation information, merged into sppsvc since Windows 8</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sppobjs.dll</code> - A plugin library containing most of the logic for product key and confirmation ID validation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cid-trick">CID Trick</h2>

<p>Our first hint of a universal SPP exploit was in 2023, with the discovery of a method we called the “CID trick”, which allowed us to deposit fake confirmation IDs.</p>

<p>Confirmation IDs (CIDs) are numeric values used for <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/product-activation-for-windows-online-support-telephone-numbers-35f6a805-1259-88b4-f5e9-b52cccef91a0">activating Windows by phone</a>, either through a dialog or with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slmgr /atp</code> command. Because phone activation can be done without being connected to any network, all Windows editions and addons have at least one licensing channel that can be phone-activated, including otherwise uncrackable products like KMS servers and ESU addons.</p>

<p>Recognizing this, asdcorp decided to investigate how CID validation worked internally. After doing a simple in-memory patch to make any provided CID valid, they noticed it had some odd effects:</p>

<p>import ReactPlayer from ‘react-player’</p>

<ReactPlayer controls="" width="100%" height="auto" url="/cidtrick.mp4" />

<p>As shown in the video, patching the CID validation code in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sppobjs.dll</code> allowed us to use a CID made of all zeroes for activation. Crucially though, this activation remained even after clearing the patch by restarting sppsvc. To us, this suggested something very important: <strong>whatever data SPP saves to remember that it’s activated is never validated after being written</strong>.</p>

<p>This was a very exciting discovery for us, as it meant that if we could write this same data, we could easily activate any copy of Windows without needing to use debuggers or <a href="https://github.com/itm4n/PPLcontrol">exploit kernel drivers</a>. More importantly for me, it also meant that this method could possibly be extended to work on older versions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_interest_(autism)">Windows 7</a> and 8, where patching SPP code at runtime is much more difficult.</p>

<p>In order make this a viable method, though, we needed to answer these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where is activation data being written?</li>
  <li>What data is written during the CID trick that causes activation?</li>
  <li>How is this data encoded?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="initial-work">Initial Work</h2>

<p>From prior investigations, we had a partial answer to the first question. Observing sppsvc using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon">Process Monitor</a>, we could see exactly where it was storing activation data:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/procmon1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>On Windows 8.1 and 10, we observed that data is mainly stored in the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Windows\System32\spp\store\2.0\data.dat</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Windows\System32\spp\store\2.0\tokens.dat</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\WPA</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Windows 8 is almost identical, except that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dat</code> files are stored under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Windows\System32\spp\store</code>.</p>

<p>Windows 7, however, is a very different story:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/procmon2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Here, I saw references to the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Windows\System32\7B296FB0-376B-497e-B012-9C450E1B7327-5P-0.C7483456-A289-439d-8115-601632D005A0</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Windows\System32\7B296FB0-376B-497e-B012-9C450E1B7327-5P-1.C7483456-A289-439d-8115-601632D005A0</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SoftwareProtectionPlatform\tokens.dat</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\WPA</code></li>
</ul>

<p>More strangely, though, I found that sppsvc wouldn’t write to either of the “7B296…” files or WPA registry keys directly. Instead, it would use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DeviceIoControl</code></a> method to call a driver known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spsys.sys</code>. This driver would then handle writing to “7B296…” files and WPA registry keys.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/procmon3.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>In comparing these files and registry keys, I saw quite a few similarities. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokens.dat</code> files were mostly uninteresting at first, since across all versions, these files seemed to just hold the contents of the XML licenses in a similarly named folder: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Windows\System32\spp\tokens</code>.</p>

<p>The “7B296…” and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data.dat</code> files seemed to serve similar roles, as these files were not only encrypted, but they seemed to have some kind of hash or signature included as well. Corrupting or deleting these files would uninstall all installed product keys and reset all other activation data (rearm counts, KMS client counts, etc.). On Windows 7, it would also show this lovely error message:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/unauth_error.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Setting aside the question of how I can’t be authorized to make changes to my own computer, after installing a product key, I get a notification for “tampering with the trusted store” across several versions:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/tamper.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Putting all this together, it would seem like the “7B296…” files and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data.dat</code> both serve as storage for important activation data, and they seem to be referred to internally as the “trusted store”.</p>

<p>A similar process of brute-force tampering with the WPA registry keys showed that they were somehow linked with the trusted store. New keys with seemingly encrypted data were added under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\WPA</code> periodically, as well as after significant licensing changes. Additionally, thanks to the <a href="https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2017/07/locking-your-registry-keys-for-fun-and.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NtLockProductActivationKeys</code></a> function, these keys were entirely read-only and unable to be deleted, unless you messed with them from a Windows PE environment. Tampering with or deleting these keys caused similar “license tampering” errors to appear, but if we copied these keys along with trusted store files from one installation to another, sppsvc didn’t seem to complain about tampering anymore.</p>

<p>From all of this work, we learned the following things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critical activation data like product keys and rearm counts are stored in something known as the “trusted store”</li>
  <li>The trusted store’s data is held in encrypted files</li>
  <li>This data is somehow linked with seemingly encrypted registry keys under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HKLM\SYSTEM\WPA</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, we didn’t know much more than this for quite a long time. My work on deobfuscating both <a href="https://github.com/UMSKT/peacestone">older</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WitherOrNot/warbird-docs">newer</a> versions of sppsvc helped us in confirming some of our theories, but without an understanding of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spsys.sys</code>, they didn’t contribute much. In the meantime, SpCreatePackaedLicense built an automated version of the CID trick, using a custom kernel driver to patch sppsvc without adjusting its <a href="https://www.alex-ionescu.com/why-protected-processes-are-a-bad-idea/">protected process</a> status, which helped greatly with testing CID trick.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/miieow1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Aside from this, though, we mostly shelved this work in favor of investigating CLiP, which seemed to have more promising avenues for exploitation.</p>

<h2 id="when-it-leaks-it-floods">When It Leaks, It Floods</h2>

<p>Although we focus heavily on Windows piracy, many of us MASSGRAVE members are also interested in its development history, or more specifically, its various pre-release beta builds. Studying and messing with these builds is not only fun as a novelty, but the artifacts that get left in during development can help us learn a lot about how Windows works.</p>

<p>While discussing activation mechanisms of recently leaked Windows 8 builds with some beta conoisseurs, I was casually blindsided with a couple major reveals:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/convo1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/convo2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Although <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_8_build_7792">build 7792</a> and <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_8_build_7850">build 7850</a> were on the path to Windows 8 development, their build numbers were close enough to Windows 7 (build 7600) that I was hopeful for some new information on spsys. Indeed, within a <a href="https://archive.org/details/Win8_7850_x64fre_symbols">symbol archive for build 7850</a>, I found symbols for spsys, along with the rest of the activation subsystem.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/symlist.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Build 7792 also had a version of spsys that was entirely unobfuscated, just as advertised, but with no symbols. Build 7850’s spsys, on the other hand, had full symbols along with full obfuscation. While I wasn’t able to have my cake and eat it too, this pairing was still an incredibly lucky finding, so I decided to use it to figure out how the trusted store works.</p>

<h2 id="spells-and-curses">Spells and Curses</h2>

<p>As usual with lucky breaks, this one came with strings attached. The biggest one was that, unlike with any other normal Windows build, kernel debugging with WinDBG didn’t work at all on build 7792, as this was one of the earliest ARM ports of Windows.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/convo3.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>So, although I had a completely deobfuscated copy of spsys without any annoying anti-debug features, I had very few options to actually debug it. Since this build was being emulated in QEMU, I still had the option of using its built-in GDB debugging server, but this would be very difficult to use, as I would have to manually locate the kernel and drivers in memory to do anything useful. Luckily, I was able to get in touch with Rairii, who was more familiar with this debugging method thanks to his work on <a href="https://github.com/Wack0/tegra2_qemu_woa">emulating early Windows on ARM</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I knew little about QEMU OS debugging, or ARM, or very low-level Windows internals, so his advice was a bit difficult to follow at first…</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/convo4.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Compounding the problem was my choice to write custom tooling for this project, using a GDB client library to control QEMU and automatically break whenever spsys loaded. Much like most of my attempts at custom tooling, this ended up being a gigantic waste of time that ultimately didn’t even work in the end, not least due to my inexperience with GDB in general. After wasting even more time trying to add Windows support to GDB through its <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/Python-API.html#Python-API">Python API</a>, I ended up biting the bullet and choosing the devil I knew, the IDA Pro debugger.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s the least “appropriate” choice for debugging a kernel or debugging QEMU (or really anything at all), but what was more important to me was that I’m familiar with it. Using the various kernel structs I grabbed and modified from <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_8_build_7915">build 7915</a>’s symbol set, I was able to crap out a script that would breakpoint on various kernel functions and grab important data, like the kernel base address and list of loaded kernel modules. By programmatically breaking on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IopLoadDriver</code>, I could even automatically update the module list as each driver was loaded.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/modlist1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>However, even with this monitoring system, I still couldn’t catch the moment that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spsys.sys</code> loaded. It was only after checking the code for its loader, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spldr.sys</code>, that I spotted an interesting call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ZwSetSystemInformation</code>:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/spsys_ld.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Referencing <a href="https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/ex/sysinfo/set.htm">Geoff Chappell’s table</a>, I saw that this corresponded to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SystemLoadGdiDriverInSystemSpace</code>, which, of course, has it’s own branch in the kernel code that can load drivers without invoking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IopLoadDriver</code>.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/kbranch.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>After breaking at this branch as well, I could finally catch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spsys.sys</code> as soon as it loaded!</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/spsys_gotcha.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>All this work, mind you, ended up implementing what would’ve been just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sxe ld spsys</code> if WinDBG worked. Regardless, I was now able to catch and debug build 7792’s spsys right as it loaded, without the annoying obfuscation and anti-debug in the way.</p>

<p>Speaking of obfuscation, I still needed to unpack build 7850’s spsys to make any sense of it. Fortunately, this was much easier, since I could search for where calls to encrypted functions are made.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/spsys_7850.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Then, I just had to break at these calls in the kernel debugger and dump the driver from memory, and I got all of the the code decrypted fairly easily. From here, it was just a long process of transferring symbols by eye, and I was finally at square one.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/labeled_funcs.png" alt="image" /></p>

<h2 id="progress-at-last">Progress At Last</h2>

<p>With all of the functions labeled, I noticed an interesting pattern in the code that generates the trusted store file, which seems to be called the “physical store”. Rather than the typical approach of storing encrypted data in a separate buffer, Microsoft seemed to opt for doing their encryption in-place.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/encrypt_data.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>This probably prevents some kind of side-channel attack, but more importantly, it means that I can “decrypt” the physical store by simply skipping this call in the debugger and letting spsys write the un-encrypted contents to the disk. And so I did:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/decrypt_ps.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>asdcorp and abbodi1406 immediately went to work, figuring out the data format and what kind of data is stored within. Meanwhile, I was focused on replicating this trick on Windows 10, where analysis would be far easier, not least due to having an actual debugger (x64dbg) available. Conveniently, the function HIDHash had some very unique constants in it:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/hidhash1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Searching for these constants in Windows 10’s sppsvc led me to the same function in sppsvc:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/hidhash2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As I found out, most of spsys’s code ended up being included in sppsvc on Windows 10. Comparing these codebases, I found all of the encryption, decryption, signature check, and hash check routines. Patching all of these routines out in the debugger, we could get sppsvc to not only decrypt its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data.dat</code> for us, but also to load and accept any modifications we made in it.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/rearm_42069.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>In the process of testing these patches, we ended up finding the long-lost product key for <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Feature_lockout_in_Windows#Windows_8">Redpill</a>, a feature lockout system for beta releases of Windows 8.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/redpill_key.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>With some experimentation and a bit of assistance from me, asdcorp managed to reproduce the CID trick, but this time without patching the CID verification routine.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/cidtrick2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>From here, asdcorp and Lyssa figured out and tested even more exploits, including a method to KMS-activate offline for over 4000 years.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/kms4k.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Although these results marked significant progress, we still needed to use a debugger to test these methods, since we had no way to decrypt and re-encrypt the physical store by ourselves. So, my next task was to figure out how to do just that.</p>

<h2 id="private-key-derivation">Private Key Derivation</h2>

<p>I knew from looking at spsys that the only real key I needed to derive was an RSA key, which encrypts an AES key that encrypts the physical store data. I also knew from tests conducted with asdcorp that there were only two such keys: one for production/official beta versions and one for internal testing/Windows Insider versions. In the absence of raw key data, we found this out with a highly advanced method: copying physical store files, editing its version, and waiting for sppsvc to crash horrifically, signaling that it could decrypt but not parse the swapped file.</p>

<p>Examining the RSA decryption routine, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SpModExpPrv</code>, I found a interpreter for a bytecode system known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ExecCodes</code>. With a lot of drudgery and regexes, I was able to write a simulator of this system in Python.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/execcodes.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Observing the output of this simulation, I realized that all of this obfuscation covered up a technique I had vaguely heard of before, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition-chain_exponentiation">addition-chain exponentiation</a>. With a bit of thinking, I realized that I could just track and dump the inputs and outputs of each modular multiplication and use this to derive the private key. All it took was x64dbg logging and a few more lines of python:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/keyderiv.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>And at last, I had the complete production key for all of SPP, from Windows Vista to Windows 11.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/prodkey.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Deriving the test key took a little while longer, due to some weird differences in how the modular multiplications were implemented, but eventually, we had every SPP private key we needed.</p>

<h2 id="nailing-the-coffin">Nailing The Coffin</h2>

<p>With the private key in hand, we were able to activate almost any edition we wanted with ease. There was still one bit of trouble, though, and that was in obtaining generic keys to enable activation.</p>

<p>On Windows 8 and up, it’s rather <a href="https://github.com/awuctl/licensing-stuff">trivial</a> to generate generic keys for any channel of any edition you wanted. However, Windows 7 and CSVLKs (KMS host keys) up to Server 2022 used <a href="https://github.com/UMSKT/writeups/blob/main/PKEY2005.md">PKEY2005</a>, a much more complicated encoding system that needed private keys to generate even generic keys. Since I didn’t have any cryptographic tricks left up my sleeve, we decided the best way through this problem was around.</p>

<p>Within the physical store are large blobs for each product key, containing various pre-computed information, such as the product IDs and phone activation data. Additionally, we found that the token store (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tokens.dat</code>) also contains metadata tying product keys to the current edition of Windows. Therefore, we figured that simply replicating this data was enough to trick Windows into thinking a key was installed, and for once, we were right.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/igpk.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>In the meantime, while developing a programmatic method for the new CID trick, which we now called ZeroCID, we were having trouble with the HWID data we needed to write into the physical store. Originally, we tried using a <a href="https://github.com/laomms/HwidGenerator">C# port of GatherOsState’s HWID derivation</a>, but this ended up failing to validate in some rare cases. Since we had few options to debug or fix this port, asdcorp decided to create an HWID value that would apply to all hardware, and yet again, it worked perfectly, even allowing transfer of activation between machines.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/tsf/uhwid.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>With the HWID validation and PKEY2005 defeated, we had now almost entirely defeated SPP’s offline protections.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Even with the amount of damage we were able to do to SPP with a debugger and a hex editor, I still think it’s a rather advanced and well-built DRM system. Its internals certainly improve upon those of Windows XP’s DRM, which, despite whatever some might tell you, was rather poorly designed. It also manages to defend itself fairly well against the most common attacks, such as resetting evaluation timers by swapping physical store files. Additionally, there are still parts of SPP that we haven’t managed to crack, like the signed XML licenses used to define its behavior. After all, it’s not like there’s another <a href="https://github.com/massgravel/MIIEow">trivial patch</a> that can bypass their signature checks…</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>• PCs made after 1997 that run Windows 98 or higher, and Mac-intosh computers such as the iMac, are likely to have USB ports built in. USB ports can also be added to older computers.</p>

<p>• The computer does not have to be turned off to connect USB devices.</p>

<p>• The same USB cable is used to connect both PCs and Macin-tosh computers.</p>

<p>• Standard A-B USB cables found in computer stores may be used.</p>

<p>• PCs must be running Windows 98 or newer to use the USB port, as Windows 95 and older do not support USB.</p>

<p>• Windows NT does not support USB</p>

<h1 id="connecting-the-mac-y-cable">Connecting the Mac Y Cable</h1>

<p>To transfer data to a Macintosh with an ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) port, use the Mac Y cable. (For Macintoshes with USB ports [iMac and newer], see the section “Connecting Your AlphaSmart 3000 to a Computer,” in this chapter.) We suggest installing the cable between your keyboard and mouse.</p>

<blockquote>

Installation of the Mac Y cable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AlphaSmart 3000 9</p>

<p>To install the Mac Y cable between your AlphaSmart 3000 and a Macintosh: 1. Unplug the mouse from your keyboard. 2. Insert the green end of the Mac Y cable into the empty ADB port on your keyboard where you just unplugged your mouse. 3. Plug your mouse into the red end of the Mac Y cable. 4. The grey end should be plugged into the computer port on the right side of your AlphaSmart 3000.</p>

<p>Note: The Mac Y cable may also be used to connect a Macintosh to an AlphaSmart 2000 or AlphaSmart Pro. To do so, connect the blue end of the Mac Y cable (instead of the grey end) into the computer port on the right side of your AlphaSmart.</p>

<p>Concerns about ADB Live Connect/Disconnect</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 is designed to be connected to and disconnected from Macintosh ADB ports while the Mac is still running. Some people may be concerned about this, since Apple recommends not unplugging or attaching an ADB device while the computer is running. This is recommended by Apple because certain ADB devices change modes when they are unplugged, causing confusion to the system when the devices are reattached. However, the AlphaSmart 3000 has been designed to not change modes when unplugged. More importantly, it does not confuse the Mac when unplugged and reconnected.</p>

<h1 id="connecting-the-pc-y-cable">Connecting the PC Y Cable</h1>

<p>The PC Y cable is used to connect the AlphaSmart 3000 to an IBM-compatible PC with a PS/2-style keyboard. (To connect to a PC with a USB port, see the section “Connecting your AlphaSmart 3000 to a USB Computer,” in this chapter.) To install the PC Y cable between your AlphaSmart 3000 and PC: 1. Turn off the computer. 10 Hardware Installation and Maintenance</p>

<ol>
  <li>Disconnect the keyboard from the computer keyboard port and determine if it is a 5-pin (larger) or Mini-DIN 6-pin (smaller) connector. a. If the keyboard has a Mini-DIN 6-pin connector… connect the orange end of the PC Y cable, labeled “Connect to PC computer port” into the keyboard port on the back of your computer. Next, connect the computer keyboard cable into the orange end of the 8-inch adapter cable. Then connect the purple end of the adapter cable to the purple end of the PC Y cable (see diagram below). b.

<p>12 Hardware Installation and Maintenance Batteries and Power Requirements</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 runs on three AA batteries of the same type (alkaline, carbon, or rechargeable). The longest battery life will be achieved with alkaline batteries. Good quality AA alkaline batteries will power the AlphaSmart 3000 for 700+ hours. (When the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned off, no power from the batteries is used.) One of the ways the AlphaSmart 3000 obtains such good battery life is by entering a low power sleep mode that uses much less power when nothing is being typed. When something is typed, the AlphaSmart 3000 wakes up, displays and saves the character, and then goes back to sleep—all transparent to the user. If a user is a slow typist or pauses while composing text, that user will get much longer battery life than a user who types 120 WPM all the time. A very slow typist can get over 700 hours of use. The fastest typist with constant use will see 350 hours or more of use. A “typical” user typing at 20 wpm constantly with no breaks will get about 700 hours of use. (The battery life hours mentioned above were measured using high quality alkaline batteries, such as Duracell or Panasonic.)</p>

<p>Warning: If several AlphaSmart 3000s are stacked on top of each other and if the one on top is offset by 1 inch to the front and 1/2 inch to the right, the rubber foot of the one on top may depress the on/off key of the AlphaSmart 3000 on the bottom. Constant depression of the on/off key by the rubber foot of the unit on top will cause a small but constant battery power drain, even though nothing is displayed on the screen. Solution: Stack your AlphaSmart 3000s on edge or make sure they are stacked verti-cally and not offset. Note: When replacing batteries, all three batteries must be changed. If one discharged AA battery is used with two new batteries, the user will see a marked reduction in the battery life—4-5 hours will be common— even though two out of the three are new batteries. AlphaSmart 3000 13 Rechargeable Battery Pack</p>

<p>For convenience, you may purchase an AlphaSmart 3000 rechargeable battery pack (please visit www.alphasmart.com for details). When the rechargeable battery pack is installed into your AlphaSmart 3000, it is automatically recharged whenever the AC adapter is plugged in, or when your AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer via a USB cable. The battery pack is charged regardless of whether the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned on or off.</p>

<p>Note: If you order a rechargeable battery pack when ordering your AlphaSmart 3000, the pack will be factory installed. If you order the pack later, you will have to install it.</p>

<h1 id="installing-a-rechargeable-battery-pack">Installing a Rechargeable Battery Pack</h1>

<p>To install the rechargeable battery pack, follow the directions below. You will need one small Phillips screwdriver. 1. Remove the eight Phillips screws on the back of the AlphaSmart 3000 case. 2. Turn the unit right side up and lift off the front of the case. 3. Remove the AA batteries, if they are installed. 4. Place the rechargeable pack in the battery compartment with the wires to the left side of the compartment. 5. Insert the white battery pack connector into connector J5 on the printed circuit board, just below and to the left of the tab key. The little bump on the connector will be up. The connector only goes in one way, so you can’t install it wrong. 14 Hardware Installation and Maintenance</p>

<ol>
  <li>Replace the top case, turn over, and replace the eight screws.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="charging-a-rechargeable-battery-pack">Charging a Rechargeable Battery Pack</h1>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 rechargeable battery pack uses NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride) cells. NiMH has no memory effect and can be charged 500–1000 times. A fully charged battery pack will power the AlphaSmart 3000 for 60–150 hours, depending on use. You will get the longest life from your battery pack if you wait for the Low Battery message to appear on the AlphaSmart 3000 screen so the pack is not needlessly recharged. The battery pack is recharged whenever the AC adapter is plugged into the AlphaSmart 3000. In addition, the AlphaSmart 3000 also recharges whenever it is connected to a computer through its USB cable (charging while the computer is on). The battery pack will charge whether the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned on or off. An overnight charge of 16 hours will give a good charge to a pack, but an over-the-weekend charge of 60 hours will fully charge a discharged pack. However, the battery pack should not be recharged for longer than a week.</p>

<p>AlphaSmart 3000 15 Storing a Rechargeable Battery Pack</p>

<p>Rechargeable batteries which are not used over time lose their charge and should be recharged before use. Always fully charge your battery before you use it after it has been stored for more than a month.</p>

<p>Lifetime of the Rechargeable Battery Pack</p>

<p>Don’t expect rechargeable batteries to last forever. Well-maintained rechargeable batteries last about 500 charges or about three years. If your battery used to last 40 hours but now only lasts one hour, it’s time for a new battery.</p>

<p>Note: If your batteries are dead and you have no AC adapter, you can still send your data to a Macintosh or PC. Simply attach the AlphaSmart 3000 to the Macintosh or PC and turn it on. The cable will supply power to the AlphaSmart 3000 while attached. You can’t do any editing, but you can transfer the data in your files.</p>

<p>Toxic Elements Statement</p>

<p>Each battery cell is a sealed container enclosing a nickel electrode and a potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The electrolyte is caustic. Avoid contact with skin or eyes. If exposed accidentally, flush eyes with water immediately. Warning: Do not incinerate or mutilate the battery, as this may cause it to burst or release toxic materials. Do not short circuit, as this may cause burns. Please dispose in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.</p>

<p>Use of Other Rechargeable Batteries</p>

<p>Rechargeable alkaline AA batteries and other rechargeable batteries may be used with the AlphaSmart 3000. However, these batteries must be recharged outside the AlphaSmart 3000. Plugging in the AlphaSmart 3000 to an AC adapter will not recharge your removable AA batteries—only the AlphaSmart 3000 rechargeable pack is recharged by the AC adapter.</p>

<p>Low Battery Indication</p>

<p>When your AA batteries or rechargeable battery pack is getting low, a message will flash on your screen: 16 Hardware Installation and Maintenance</p>

<p>Low Battery!!</p>

<p>The Low Battery message will appear about eight hours before your AA batteries are dead and about 20 minutes before your rechargeable batteries are dead.</p>

<p>Battery Status Indicator</p>

<p>A display of the current battery charge level is available within AlphaWord when you use the keyboard command ctrl-x-B. This display shows a graphical representation of the battery charge level. In addition, the graphical representation of the battery charge level is shown in the startup screen when the AlphaSmart 3000 is powered on, and in the screen that you see when you change files in AlphaWord.</p>

<p>Note: Available only with AlphaSmart 3000 v 1.4 or higher</p>

<p>Lithium Battery</p>

<p>AlphaSmart 3000 also uses a secondary backup battery that is not user-accessible. This 3V lithium coin cell battery (CR2032) powers the memory, preventing data loss when the unit is turned off and the primary AA batteries or rechargeable battery pack are dead. This lithium battery should be good for approximately 7–10 years. It is mounted in a socket and is replaceable. To determine if the 3V lithium battery has been discharged: 1. Enter some text into the AlphaSmart 3000. 2. Turn the unit off. 3. Remove the AA batteries and make sure the unit is not plugged into the AC adapter or attached to a Macintosh. 4. Wait two minutes. 5. Replace the AA batteries or plug the AlphaSmart 3000 into an AC adapter. 6. Turn the unit back on. If the text you entered is still there, then the lithium battery is still good. If the text has disappeared and AlphaSmart 3000 17</p>

<p>the file is empty, then the lithium battery has been discharged and should be replaced.</p>

<p>Warning: This procedure may result in data loss. Transfer important files from the AlphaSmart 3000 before proceeding.</p>

<p>To replace the lithium battery, you must take the case apart. See the “Troubleshooting” chapter for instructions. Please dispose of the dis-charged lithium battery properly.</p>

<p>Tips on Caring For Batteries</p>

<p>• To avoid battery leakage, change the batteries as soon as they become weak.</p>

<p>• Do not drop, puncture, disassemble, mutilate or incinerate the bat-teries.</p>

<p>• Recharge only batteries that are rechargeable, and then only as directed in the manual.</p>

<p>• Do not leave batteries in hot locations.</p>

<p>• When storing the AlphaSmart 3000 for several months (like over the summer), remove the batteries.</p>

<h1 id="power">Power</h1>

<p>When connecting the AlphaSmart 3000 to a computer, do not connect the AC adapter. Using the AC adapter is not necessary as the AlphaSmart 3000 will use the power available in the keyboard cable, even if no batteries are installed. The DC jack input will accept 7.5-9V DC with a minimum current rating of 200mA. Off-the-shelf AC adapters may be used at your own risk and should be marked with the ratings as shown. The DC jack polarity is negative 18 Hardware Installation and Maintenance</p>

<p>(grounded) on the outside and positive in the middle. Full testing was done with the AC adapter from AlphaSmart, Inc. and use with any other AC adapter is not guaranteed. If damage occurs because of use with another AC/DC adapter, repair is not covered under the warranty.</p>

<h1 id="auto-power-on">Auto Power-On</h1>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 will power on automatically when connected via USB to a powered-on AlphaHub, or via USB, PC Y cable, or Mac Y cable to a powered-on computer, and will remain on until the cable is disconnected or the AlphaHub or computer is turned off. When the cable is disconnected or power is removed from the cable, the AlphaSmart 3000 will return to the state it was in before connecting, i.e. if it was off before connecting, it will turn off again when disconnected.</p>

<p>Note: This feature may not be available on older AlphaSmart 3000s.</p>

<p>• Data Recovery</p>

<p>• Spell Check</p>

<h1 id="entering-text">Entering Text</h1>

<p>When you first turn on your AlphaSmart 3000, you will see the start-up screen for a few seconds, which gives your AlphaSmart 3000 version number (for example, AlphaWord v1.x.x, English) and the number of the file it is opening. Then the screen will display the contents of your file. The cursor will be in the same position it was when the AlphaSmart 3000 was last used. To enter text, simply begin typing as you would on any other keyboard. Use the backspace key to erase. As soon as you type each character it is automat-ically saved. There is no Save command. The arrow keys allow you to move your cursor through the text. Additionally, the following keyboard combi-nations will also move your cursor as specified:</p>

<p>x-o moves the cursor up four lines (one displayed page)</p>

<p>x-, moves the cursor down four lines (one displayed page) 20 Using Your AlphaSmart 3000</p>

<p>x-k moves the cursor to the beginning of the line</p>

<p>x-l moves the cursor to the end of the line</p>

<p>Home moves the cursor to the beginning of the document</p>

<p>End moves the cursor to the end of the document As with any word processing application, the text will automatically wrap at the end of each line, so you should use the enter key only to separate paragraphs.</p>

<h1 id="text-formatting">Text Formatting</h1>

<p>All text formatting, including margins, tab stops, font, size, and other styling attributes, are done on the desktop computer after the file has been transferred from the AlphaSmart 3000. Only the characters themselves (ASCII key codes) are transferred from the AlphaSmart 3000 to the computer. However, the tab key can be used on the AlphaSmart 3000 to create columns or paragraph indentations which will transfer to the Macintosh and PC with the file. When the tab key is used, it will appear as a right arrow on the AlphaSmart 3000 screen when Show Marks is activated. See the Advanced AlphaSmart 3000 Features – Show Marks section for further information. Although text will not appear indented on your AlphaSmart 3000, it will show up indented on your computer. The AlphaSmart 3000 has cut, copy, and paste functions included. See the following section “Editing Text” for more information.</p>

<p>Note: These editing features can also be performed once a file has been transferred to the desktop computer, and may be easier to perform using a larger screen and mouse.</p>

<p>Caps Lock Indicator</p>

<p>When Caps Lock is active, the lower right character of the screen will be solid black. Pressing the Caps Lock key toggles the caps lock on and off. AlphaSmart 3000 21 Editing Text</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 has cut, copy, and paste functions for convenience in editing text. To use these features, begin by moving the cursor under the first letter of the first word in the text you want to select. When you hold down the shift key along with any of the arrow keys, you will notice a flashing block cursor appear over the letter. Use the arrow keys to select the text that you wish to cut, copy or delete. Pressing ctrl-A or x-A will select the entire contents of the file. Once you have selected the text, the following functions can be used:</p>

<p>• Cut/Delete: In order to delete the selected text, use the Cut com-mand ( ctrl-X or x-X ) to move the text to the clipboard, or the backspace key to delete the text entirely.</p>

<p>• Copy: To copy the selected text to the clipboard without deleting it, use the Copy command ( ctrl-C or x-C ).</p>

<p>• Paste: After selected text has been cut or copied, reposition your cursor and use the Paste command ( ctrl-V or x-V ) to place the clip-board contents at the new cursor location. Once you have copied or cut the text, it will reside on the clipboard until the next cut or copy action takes place. The current contents of the clipboard can be viewed at any time using the command ctrl-option-x-C . The contents can be inserted to a new location in the current file, or to a completely different file. The first three lines are the contents of the clipboard, and the last is a prompt. The arrow keys can be used to maneuver your cursor within the clipboard. The standard clipboard size is 25 KB (the same size of each file on the AlphaSmart 3000), and changes when other SmartApplets are installed, so 22 Using Your AlphaSmart 3000</p>

<p>entire files can be selected and copied to the clipboard if necessary. To select all the data within a file, press x-A .You can view the clipboard status by pressing option-x-C . This command gives you the number of text pages currently in the clipboard, and how much empty space is still available.</p>

<h1 id="find-feature">Find Feature</h1>

<p>To access the AlphaSmart Find feature, press the find key or x-F. You will see a screen that says:</p>

<p>Find:<strong>__</strong>___ Press Enter to search in file 1, Option-Enter to search in all files, CMD-G to Find again, Esc to exit.</p>

<p>At the cursor, you may enter up to 16 characters. The search is not case sensitive, so if you are looking for “CAT” and type in “cat”, the search will find cat, CAT, Cat, or caT. It will also find partial words or characters embedded in other words. For example, if you searched for “cat”, it will also show you “catalog.” If you press enter after entering your search text, it will search in the current file only. If you press Option-Enter , it will search in all eight files. However, if password protection is activated, the Option-Enter command cannot be used and you can only search in the current file. When a string is found in a different file than the one currently displayed, it will open that file and put a cursor at the end of the string it found. After the text is found once, you may continue the search by pressing</p>

<p>x-G . The next occurrence will be displayed or the message Text NOT found will be displayed. ( x-G does not bring up the Find dialog screen, unless this is the first time you are using the Find function.) AlphaSmart 3000 23 Working with Files</p>

<p>The first time that the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned on, it will display the message Opening file 1. On subsequent startups, it will automatically open the last file used.</p>

<p>File Capacity</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 supports eight files, which are each 12.5 pages in length, or about 25 KB. This provides a total storage capacity of 100 pages of single-spaced text or 200,000 characters. This file structure is intended to support multiple users or to enable a single user to organize his or her work into chapters or sections. To move between files, press the file 1 key to go to File 1, the file 2 key to go to File 2 and so forth, up to File 8. When an AlphaSmart 3000 file is full, a message will be displayed which reads:</p>

<p>File is full. Use another file or send data to your computer.</p>

<p>File Status</p>

<p>The file status dialog box can be accessed by pressing x-I while in a file. The box displays the current number of pages in a file, and how much space is left.</p>

<p>Erasing Files</p>

<p>Text entered into each file will remain there until you explicitly erase it by pressing the clear file key while the AlphaSmart 3000 is not attached to a desktop computer. This will produce a prompt, asking if you are sure. Press Y for yes, and N for no. Note that when you press the clear file key, you are clearing only the file in which you are currently working; other files will remain unchanged. Once the clear file key is pressed and the file is deleted, information may still be recovered using the Data Recovery command described below. However, for confidential files which you wish to erase without the ability to recover, 24 Using Your AlphaSmart 3000</p>

<p>you may press option-x-clear file . This command permanently erases the contents of the entire file. Use this command with care.</p>

<p>Clear All Files Command</p>

<p>Press option-x-ctrl-shift-clear file to erase all eight files simulta-neously. You will be asked if you are sure—pressing the Y key at this point will clear files 1 through 8. However, this deletion is not permanent, and you can still recover any of the files using the Data Recovery command described below as long as you have not typed new text into the files.</p>

<h1 id="data-recovery">Data Recovery</h1>

<p>If you accidentally clear a file, it can still be recovered as long as no text has been entered into that file yet. Open the file you wish to recover by pressing one of the file 1–file 8 keys. Press option-x-R to activate the AlphaSmart Data Recovery command. The Data Recovery command restores the end-of-file marker to the same position it was when the file was last cleared (by pressing the clear</p>

<p>file key). So if you accidentally clear a file, option-x-R will restore it. If, however, the Data Recovery command fails to recover the data, try pressing ctrl-option-x-R . This is the Recover 40 Characters command. Each time you press this command it will move the end-of-file marker back 40 characters. Press this command repeatedly until you see all of your text, plus some “garbage.” Then hold the backspace key down until the garbage characters are deleted. You may also try pressing shift-ctrl-option-x-R to recover the entire file. Scroll down to the end of your text where the garbage characters start and press x-backspace to erase from the cursor to the end of the file.</p>

<p>Note: If the file was deleted using the option-x-clear file command, the data is not recoverable. AlphaSmart 3000 25 Spell Check</p>

Press the send key (at the extreme upper right of the AlphaSmart 3000 keyboard) to initiate the transfer of the current file from the AlphaSmart 3000 to the computer. If you want to abort a file transfer, press the esc 28 Transferring Text to a Computer</p>

<p>key. You must have an application that accepts text (such as a word processing or multimedia application) already open on the computer, and have the cursor placed in the file where you wish to insert the text before pressing the send key. Be sure to be within the application and not the Finder or Desktop when you press the send key, or you may rename your files to the text in your AlphaSmart 3000. When connected and sending files to the computer, the AlphaSmart 3000 screen will display a progress bar, and the show the percent of the file that has been sent. 2. When the transfer is complete, disconnect the AlphaSmart 3000. (You may also leave the AlphaSmart 3000 connected to the computer for use as a normal keyboard.) You may continue to download several files while still attached to the computer. To switch between files while the AlphaSmart 3000 is still attached to your computer: 1. For Macs: Press option-x-file 1 to go to File 1, option-x-file 2 to go to File 2, and so forth. 2. For PCs: Press x-file 1 to go to File 1, x-file 2 to go to File 2, and so forth. Do not press the alt/option key. Pressing the alt key on PCs puts some word processing programs into command mode and the file won’t transfer correctly. 3. To finish the transfer process, save the word processing file on the computer. Once the text is saved on your computer, you can style, format and print the file as you would with any other file in your word processing application. 4. To erase the transferred file from the AlphaSmart 3000, press the clear file key on the AlphaSmart 3000. The currently displayed file will be deleted. AlphaSmart 3000 29 Keyboard Command Differences</p>

<p>When the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer, all of the keys except the send key behave as standard keyboard keys. Any characters that are typed will appear on the computer screen. When the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a PC:</p>

<p>print is the same as PrtScrn</p>

<p>shift-print is the same as Pause</p>

<p>Connecting to PC-compatible Laptops</p>

<p>To get an AlphaSmart 3000 to upload to a PC-compatible laptop computer, you must connect the AlphaSmart 3000 the exact same way you would attach an external keyboard to your laptop. Unfortunately, each different PC compatible laptop computer seems to have its own different, often non-obvious, way to connect to an external keyboard. For example, some IBM Thinkpad laptops have a Mini-DIN 6 port with a mouse and keyboard icon near it. One might logically think that one could plug in a mouse or Mini-DIN 6 (PS/2 style) keyboard and expect it to work. Even though it fits, it won’t work. To overcome this problem, you need a special adapter cable that plugs in the port. You may find the adapter at a computer store. AlphaSmart, Inc. does not sell this adapter. 30 Transferring Text to a Computer</p>

<p>Another example is a particular Hitachi laptop model that has a tiny switch that must be turned on in order to get an external keyboard to work. Some laptops (reported with some Compaq models), when attached to the PC, require pressing the enter key on the AlphaSmart 3000 before pressing the send key. (Tech note: Pressing the enter key causes the laptop to switch from listening to the internal keyboard to listening to an external one, e.g. the AlphaSmart 3000.) Since there are so many different types of laptops and differing ways that they each handle external keyboards, you must look in your laptop’s user manual for instructions on connecting an external keyboard. It is best if you can test it with an external PC keyboard first before trying it with an AlphaSmart 3000. If an external keyboard can type into your laptop, then the AlphaSmart 3000 should also be able to connect, type, and send information to your laptop.</p>

<h1 id="transferring-text-using-infrared">Transferring Text Using Infrared</h1>

<p>With infrared, you can transfer the contents of your AlphaSmart 3000 to a computer or printer without using cables. If your AlphaSmart 3000 has a built-in infrared module, you can send text via infrared to a Mac, PC, or printer. Since the AlphaSmart uses the 100 percent error-free industry standard for infrared (IrDA), it will transfer text to any computer or printer with a built-in IrDA transceiver. You must have AlphaBeam software or Get Utility 3.0 or newer installed on your computer to enable the transfer (see the following sections for more information). It’s easy to use infrared to transfer files. Point the AlphaSmart 3000 towards the computer’s infrared transceiver and press the send key. Text will be transferred to the document or file that is open on the computer. To print, hit the print key on the AlphaSmart 3000 while pointing it towards the printer’s infrared transceiver or module. The AlphaSmart 3000 can be up to three feet (one meter) away while transferring text to and from a computer or printer. AlphaSmart 3000 31</p>

<p>Some of the Macintosh computers equipped with a built-in IrDA transceiver include iMacs (Rev A), the Powerbook 3400C, and the Powerbook G3.</p>

<p>Note: If the computer does not have a built-in IrDA transceiver, you will need to purchase an IrDA infrared serial adapter for Mac or PC from AlphaSmart, Inc. in order to transfer text using infrared. To print with infrared to a printer that does not have built-in infrared, you will need to purchase an IrDA printer adapter from the printer manufacturer, or from one of the companies listed on our website at www.alphasmart.com</p>

<p>Note: Additional installation steps are required if Windows 98 and infrared are being used.</p>

<h1 id="alphabeam--for-mac">AlphaBeam ™ for Mac</h1>

<p>AlphaBeam for Mac is a software program that allows the user to send text to a Macintosh equipped with a built-in IrDA transceiver or an IrDA infrared serial adapter, from an AlphaSmart 3000 equipped with the optional infrared module. The program can transfer text from an AlphaSmart 3000 into any Mac program that allows text input.</p>

<h1 id="sending-text-to-applications">Sending Text to Applications</h1>

<p>Since the AlphaSmart 3000 simply retypes the data from your files, you can transfer the text in an AlphaSmart 3000 file to any application that you can type into—not just word processing applications.</p>

<p>Sending to Applications</p>

<p>When in another application, simply put the cursor where you want the text to go and press the send key on the AlphaSmart 3000. This can be a multi-media text field, or when using the text tool of a page layout program, or in an e-mail program. Wherever you would normally type in the information, you can easily download information from an AlphaSmart 3000 by placing your cursor at that point in the new appli-cation and pressing send .</p>

<p>Spreadsheets</p>

<p>You can transfer text directly into a spreadsheet if you are using TurboTransfer Software or Infrared Transfer. However, for some spreadsheet applications, transferring the text directly via a cable will not produce the desired results, as shown in the following example: 1. Open a spreadsheet application and create a new spreadsheet. 2. Put the cursor into the upper left cell of the spreadsheet file. 3. Press send on your AlphaSmart 3000. AlphaSmart 3000 33</p>

<p>Your spreadsheet should look like this: Using the return or enter key at the end of each line causes most spreadsheets to drop straight down a row, instead of going back to the leftmost column of the spreadsheet. To avoid this: 1. Transfer your text to a word processor application. 2. Select the text and copy it. 3. Paste it into your spreadsheet. The paste command will fix the problem and your spreadsheet will look like this:</p>

<p>Note: If you are using TurboTransfer or Infrared Transfer, there is no need to use the procedure shown above. Both transfer methods will paste your text into the spreadsheet correctly.</p>

<p>Databases</p>

<p>The steps below work for transferring text to an AppleWorks (formerly ClarisWorks) database document on a Macintosh. Database programs differ</p>

<p>A B C D E1 98 46 78 2 75 89 100 A B C1 98 46 78 2 75 89 100 34 Transferring Text to a Computer</p>

<p>substantially, so transferring to other databases may require experimen-tation. 1. Create your database in AppleWorks if you haven’t already done so, and set up your fields. 2. Create a tab-delimited record on the AlphaSmart 3000 by entering the data in the tab order of the database, and then pressing the enter key at the end of each record. The tabs separate the fields and the return indicates the end of the previous record and the beginning of the next one. Enter as many records as you want in a single AlphaSmart 3000 file— you do not need to save each record into a separate file. 3. Open the database in AppleWorks on the Macintosh. 4. Open a new empty word processing file. 5. Connect the AlphaSmart to the Mac keyboard cable. 6. Download the data file from the AlphaSmart 3000 to the empty AppleWorks word processing document by pressing the send</p>

<p>key on the AlphaSmart 3000. 7. Select all the downloaded text by choosing Select All from the Mac Edit menu. ( x-A ). 8. Copy the data to the clipboard by choosing Copy from the Edit menu ( x-C or ctrl-C ). 9. Make the database the active AppleWorks document, either by choosing the database file in the View menu or by clicking once in the database window (Do not click on an individual field in the document to make it the active field or all the data will be put into the one field). 10.Paste the data from the clipboard by selecting Paste from the Edit menu or by pressing x-V or ctrl-V . The data will be transferred to the database, beginning with the second record if there was already a record in the database (a newly-created database will have an empty record as the first record). AlphaSmart 3000 35</p>

<p>11.Delete the empty record if needed. Save and close the database. Reopen to verify that the data is there and transmitted correctly. Discard the data in the unnamed text file. Subsequent transmissions of new data will be appended to the end of the database and will not create a new blank record. If the database contains calculated fields, you may simply skip the field by entering a tab. When the data is pasted it will make the calculations automatically in the database. If you find errors in the way the data appears in the database after it has been transferred, you can make the corrections in the original AlphaSmart file and then retransmit the data to the word processing file.</p>

<h1 id="changing-the-transfer-speed">Changing the Transfer Speed</h1>

<p>The AlphaSmart can send text faster than some older computers can accept it. If you notice missing characters or jumbled text, then you need to slow down the transfer speed. Even on newer, faster computers, some programs like Microsoft Word, KidWorks™, and Student Writing Center are slow to accept text and you must slow down the AlphaSmart to transfer text into these programs. The AlphaSmart file transfer speed menu is accessed by the keyboard command option-x-S . This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart is attached to a computer. The speed command affects both Mac sending speed and PC sending speed. The AlphaSmart has four file transfer speeds: 1. Very Slow is the slowest speed setting and is compatible with all machines and applications. It is recommended especially when you use graphics intensive programs such as KidWorks or Student Writing Center. If you still lose data sending to KidWorks 2, turn Sound Effects off by deselecting it under the KidWorks 2 Options menu. 36 Transferring Text to a Computer</p>

<ol>
  <li>Slow is compatible with all machines and most applications. It is recommended especially if you are using a Mac Classic, an Apple IIGS or a PC AT (286). 3. Faster (the default speed), and is recommended for the Mac LC or for 386- and 486-based PCs. 4. Fastest provides the quickest transfers. However, some word processing programs may experience a loss of data when files are transferred using this mode, so you may wish to experiment to see which speed works best for you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: The keyboard control panel in your Macintosh system may also need to be adjusted to a faster setting.</p>

<p>If you are using a Mac, you can significantly speed up the transfer of data (approximately six times faster) by using TurboTransfer software (see the section “TurboTransfer Software” later in this manual).</p>

<p>Send speed for Mac</p>

<p>• 1.25 pages per minute (set at speed 4, sending to AppleWorks on a Power Mac).</p>

<p>• With TurboTransfer: 8 pages per minute.</p>

<p>Send speed for PC</p>

<p>• 5 pages per minute (set at speed 4, sending to Windows Write, on a 486). AlphaSmart 3000 37 CHAPTER 7 SmartApplets Highlights</p>

<p>• The AlphaSmart 3000 Parallel Printer Cable</p>

<p>• Printers with DIP Switch Settings The AlphaSmart 3000 can print directly to a large number of printers by using a specially designed parallel printer cable or Apple printer cable (serial). Printers currently supported by the AlphaSmart 3000 are listed in the Support Section of our website at www.alphasmart.com</p>

<h1 id="printing-directly-from-an-alphasmart-3000">Printing directly from an AlphaSmart 3000</h1>

<ol>
  <li>The first time you use a printer, press option-print to access the printer setup menu. Use the arrow keys to select the appropriate printer from the list given. Your chosen printer will be indicated by a plus sign (+) in front of the printer name. Press enter to leave the menu. 2. Connect the serial cable or AlphaSmart 3000 parallel cable from the AlphaSmart 3000 serial port (on the left-hand side, marked “printer”) to the printer serial or parallel port. The parallel cable is specially made and is not available from computer stores—it has 42 Printing from the AlphaSmart 3000</li>
</ol>

<p>some electronic components built directly into the cable. The serial printer cable is a standard Apple printer cable available at any computer store. 3. Make sure the printer is turned on and, for the ImageWriter II, make sure the Select LED is green (printer is selected to print). 4. Press x-P or the print key on the AlphaSmart 3000 to print the current file. The printer should start to print. The AlphaSmart 3000 will remember your selected printer, so you only have to do Step 1 once, or whenever you change printers.</p>

<p>Note: Font, print quality, line spacing, and margins are based on printer defaults (not AlphaSmart), are fixed, and are not changeable by the user. The line spacing is set for double spacing for easy manual editing.</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 supports printing to older direct-connect printers. If your printer is already connected to a computer or a network, most users find it easier and faster to leave the printer connected to the computer or network, and download the text to the computer for printing.</p>

<p>Printers with DIP switch settings</p>

<h1 id="autorepeatkey-repeat-control">AutoRepeat/Key Repeat Control</h1>

<p>With Key Repeat Control enabled, only one character prints per keystroke. For example, if you hold down the letter “a” key for an extended period of time, you would expect to see the letter continually repeat itself on your screen (“aaaaaaa”). However, with the Key Repeat Control enabled, you would obtain just one “a”, regardless of how long the key was held. The AutoRepeat function can be disabled or enabled by pressing option-x-K to get to the AutoRepeat/Key Repeat Control screen, and then pressing 1. This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer. 46 Advanced AlphaSmart 3000 Features Sticky Keys</p>

<p>With Sticky Keys enabled, you can type combination keystrokes without actually pressing the keys simultaneously. For example, you could press option-x-S individually in order (instead of simultaneously as a group) to get to the AlphaSmart Transfer Speed menu. Sticky Keys affects the four modifier keys: shift, option, command ( x), and control. When Sticky Keys is enabled, pressing a modifier key effec-tively keeps that key “pressed down” for the next normal key press. To enable the Sticky Keys function, press option-x-K and then 2 to either enable or disable Sticky Keys. This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer. The current state of the shift, option, command, control, and caps lock keys are shown in the lower right of the AlphaSmart 3000 screen. The last five characters in the lower right corner of the display show which keys are down and which keys are up.</p>

<p>• The right-most character is the caps lock indicator, and is solid black if the caps lock key has been pressed. Caps lock is not affected by the Sticky Keys settings.</p>

<p>• The second character from the bottom right corner is the com-mand ( x) key indicator. If the command key is down, a C will be displayed here.</p>

<p>• The third character from the bottom right corner of the screen is the option key indicator. If the option key is down, an O will be displayed.</p>

<p>• The fourth character from the lower right corner of the screen is the control key indicator. If the control key is down, a C will be displayed here.</p>

<p>• The fifth character from the lower right corner of the screen is the shift key indicator. If the shift key is down, an S will be dis-played here. AlphaSmart 3000 47 Slow Keys</p>

<p>Slow Keys is designed to allow a user with unsteady hands or difficulty in targeting specific keys to set a delay time between depressing a key and the generation of the associated character. The Slow Keys control screen can be displayed with the keyboard command ctrl-option-x-K .To turn Slow Keys on, use the up-arrow or right-arrow key to select a delay value greater than zero (a zero value turns Slow Keys off). Use the down-arrow or left-arrow to decrease the delay value. Once the desired delay value is displayed, press enter to set that value, or esc to cancel any changes you have made. The AutoRepeat delay, which is normally about one second, will be increased to match the Slow Keys delay if it is greater than one second. For example, a Slow Keys delay setting of 1.5 seconds will set the AutoRepeat delay to about 1.5 seconds as well. This means that, after pressing and holding a key down, there would be a 1.5-second delay before a character appeared, and after an additional 1.5 seconds, that character would begin to AutoRepeat. The Slow Keys delay does not apply to key use in the Slow Keys control screen.</p>

<h1 id="show-marks">Show Marks</h1>

<p>When Show Marks is enabled, pressing the tab key will produce an arrow (l) on your screen and pressing the enter key will produce a return arrow (å) on your screen. When Show Marks is disabled, both commands show up as spaces on the AlphaSmart 3000 screen. Regardless of the Show Marks setting, both tabs and returns are transferred to the computer as tabs and returns. The Show Marks function can be disabled or enabled by pressing option-x-</p>

<p>K, and then pressing 3. This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer. 48 Advanced AlphaSmart 3000 Features Alternate Keyboard Layouts</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 gives you a choice of four different keyboard layouts to provide for special education needs. To change the keyboard layout, press option-x-L . This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer. You will see four choices:</p>

<p>• Pressing 1 chooses QWERTY—the standard default layout of most keyboards and typewriters.</p>

<p>• Pressing 2 sets the keyboard to Dvorak. Dvorak is a scientifically-designed key layout which requires much less finger reaching and stretching for the most commonly-used keys, and results in faster and easier typing.</p>

<p>• Pressing 3 sets the keyboard layout for right-hand only, and select-ing 4 sets the keyboard for left-hand only. Right and left one-handed layouts enable faster typing for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>When the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned on, a message will display the current layout option selected, if other than the default QWERTY layout.</p>

<p>Note: When you switch keyboard layouts, all dialog boxes and key commands are driven from the new layout. For example, to access the Speed Menu, press x on any of the keyboard layouts, regardless of where the keys are located. (This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart 3000 is connected to a computer.)</p>

<p>Note: AlphaSmart 3000 keys are removable and may be popped off and repositioned to match the new layout you choose.</p>

<p>Note: When transferring data to a PC (using an AlphaSmart 3000 with either a QWERTY or Dvorak layout) the PC must use a QWERTY layout.</p>

</ol>

<p>Press option-x-V to get to the system status screen. This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer. This screen tells you the AlphaSmart 3000 version number, what the current file number is, and the status of the AutoRepeat, Sticky Keys, and Password Protection features, as well as which keyboard layout option is currently in use.</p>

<h1 id="alphasmart-3000-password-protection">AlphaSmart 3000 Password Protection</h1>

<p>When multiple users share one AlphaSmart 3000, it is sometimes useful to password protect each file to keep the contents private and protected from accidental loss. The AlphaSmart 3000 is shipped with password protection disabled. To enable AlphaSmart’s password protection feature for the first time, you will need to contact AlphaSmart, Inc. to obtain the master password encoded into each AlphaSmart 3000. To obtain the master password, call toll-free at (888) 274-2720. You may also fax your request (please include your fax number) to (530) 528-3906.</p>

<p>Enabling the Password Option</p>

<ol>
  <li>Turn the AlphaSmart 3000 on and make sure it is not connected to a computer. 2. Press ctrl-option-x-p to show the Password Enable/Disable screen. The AlphaSmart 3000 will display the message:</li>

<ol>
  <li>Passwords are enabled. Press the esc key to exit the password screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Setting an Individual Password</p>

<p>Each of the eight files can have their own unique password. When the password feature is enabled, each individual file password is initially set to “write”. If eight different students are to share an AlphaSmart 3000, instruct each student to set their own private password for their own file. Tell them to use “write” as the old password.</p>

<p>Changing a Password</p>

<ol>
  <li>Turn the AlphaSmart 3000 on and make sure it is not connected to a computer. Open file x (you might need to enter the password if password protection is on). 2. Press option-x-P to show the Change Password dialog box. If pressed in file 4, you will see:</li>
</ol>

<p>Change password for file 4Old password: <strong>___ New password: __</strong>_ Press esc key to exit.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First type the old password, which is “write” if this is the first time. (If you have forgotten the old password, the master password may be entered by the teacher). As you type the old password, Xs will appear for each character. If you type the password incorrectly, the message Invalid password, please try again will appear, and you can try again. When you correctly type the old password, your screen will say:</li>
</ol>

<p>Change password for file 4Old password: XXXXX AlphaSmart 3000 55</p>

<p>New password: <strong>__</strong>_ Press esc key to exit.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The cursor will be in the third row, waiting for you to type in the new password. Any letters or numbers can be used for the password. Unlike the old password, each character of the new password will be displayed as it is typed. If you don’t want anyone to see your password, be sure to type your password in a private location.</li>
</ol>

<p>Change password for file 4Old password: XXXXX New password: abcde Press esc key to exit.</p>

<p>As soon as you type the 6th letter of the new password, you will be prompted to reenter the master password a 2nd time. Once you’ve entered it the 2nd time, hit the Enter key and you will see message “Your password has been changed” appear for a second, and then you will return to the original file opened. (Passwords are all lowercase; shift or caps lock has no effect.) Please note that the Master Password can be changed. For detailed instructions, please call AlphaSmart directly. When password protection is enabled, anytime you change files you will be asked for that file’s password before being allowed to edit that file. All individual file passwords can be overridden by typing the master password. If, when turning on the AlphaSmart 3000, you are prompted for the password for a file that isn’t yours, simply press the appropriate file number to get your own file and enter your password.</p>

<p>Password Reset</p>

<p>AlphaWord file passwords can all be reset to the factory default value using the keyboard command ctrl-shift-option-x-P and entering the master password. AlphaWord file passwords can be any length from 1 to 6 characters. Backspace and Tab characters cannot be used in passwords, and the 56 Advanced AlphaSmart 3000 Features</p>

<p>backspace key will erase the preceding character in a password entry field.</p>

<p>Note: This password system was designed to protect against accidental or casual mischievous data loss and to provide a minimum level of data privacy. It is not designed to prevent concerted malicious efforts at data destruction. All security systems have ways of being “broken” if you try hard enough.</p>

<h1 id="battery-status-indicator">Battery Status Indicator</h1>

<p>A display of the current battery charge level is available within AlphaWord when you use the keyboard command ctrl-x-B . This display shows a graphical representation of the battery charge level.

<p>Following is a list of difficulties you may encounter while using AlphaSmart 3000 and the solutions to these common problems.</p>

<p>When a file is transferred to the Macintosh, some of the characters do not show up or appear not to have transferred.</p>

<p>• If a USB cable is being used, verify that the AlphaSmart 3000 is run-ning AlphaWord v1.4 or higher. In the word processing program on the computer, turn off Auto Correct, Spelling, URL, etc. features.</p>

<p>• Disconnect the AlphaSmart 3000 from the Macintosh and check the file transfer speed by pressing option-x-S . Reset the AlphaSmart 3000 to a slower setting (speed 1 is the slowest).</p>

<p>• Try using a different word processing program. Some programs allow the AlphaSmart 3000 to transfer data faster than others.</p>

<p>• Adjust the keyboard control panel in the Macintosh system to a faster speed to maximize the file transfer speed.</p>

<p>My PC beeps when I send text to it.</p>

<p>• Make sure you have a word processor file open on the PC.</p>

<p>• Try changing to a lower send speed by disconnecting the AlphaSmart 3000 and pressing option-x-S .</p>

<p>Nothing appears on the AlphaSmart 3000 screen when I turn it on.</p>

<p>• Check your batteries. Plug your AlphaSmart 3000 into the AC adapter—if it turns on, your batteries are discharged or have been 60 Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions</p>

<p>improperly inserted. Make sure the batteries are oriented as indicated in the battery cavity.</p>

<p>• If the screen is blank except for a flashing cursor in the upper left corner of the screen, then you are simply in an empty file. Start typing and characters should appear on your screen.</p>

<p>When I attach my AlphaSmart 3000 to my computer, I can’t send any data and my AlphaSmart 3000 screen shows my file instead of the “Attached to…” message.</p>

<p>• Check the cable connections—one may be loose.</p>

<p>• If using a PC Y cable or Mac Y cable, check the computer ends of the cable for bent or broken pins.</p>

<p>Note: Young users are more likely to bend these pins.</p>

<p>When I start up the AlphaSmart 3000, I see something other than the file that I expected.</p>

<p>• Make sure you are in the correct file. AlphaSmart 3000 sup-ports eight different files. To change files, press file 1 to go to file 1, file 2 to go to file 2, and so on.</p>

<p>I try to type in a file, but no characters show up.</p>

<p>• First, check the status of the Slow Keys settings</p>

<p>• If the file looks empty, press the clear file key to make sure the file is erased. Then try typing again. (Sometimes the file recov-ery command option-x-R gets hit by mistake, filling up the file so that you can’t type any more into it. See the Data Recovery section for more details.) AlphaSmart 3000 61</p>

<p>• If you can’t see the cursor on the screen, then your batteries may be too low. Check your batteries or plug in your AC adapter.</p>

<p>My file (or the end of my file) is filled with garbage.</p>

<p>• If you have no useful text in the file, just press the clear file key to erase the entire file.</p>

<p>• If you have some data you would like to save, go to where the gar-bage characters start and press x-backspace to delete from the cur-sor to the end of the file.</p>

<p>• Send the file, and then cancel the transfer when garbage shows up.</p>

<p>When I transfer text to my PC, the case of the characters is reversed; all the lowercase characters show up as uppercase, and the uppercase characters show up as lowercase.</p>

<p>• The caps lock key was probably pressed on the PC keyboard when the AlphaSmart 3000 was connected. The computer remembers that the caps lock is on and does the case reversal. To fix it, simply press the caps lock key once either on the normal PC keyboard or on the AlphaSmart 3000 when it is attached to the PC (when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to the PC, it functions as a normal keyboard). Before sending from the AlphaSmart 3000, it is often a good idea to try typing a few characters from the AlphaSmart 3000 keyboard to see if it transfers correctly to the PC screen. If not, press the AlphaSmart 3000 caps lock key once to fix it, and then type a few keys to verify that it is correct.</p>

<p>The previous contents of the Clipboard show up in my document instead of the AlphaSmart 3000 file.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Press x-Z twice, or 2. Press x-V or ctrl-V to paste the AlphaSmart 3000 file, or 3. Press the send key again on your AlphaSmart 3000. 62 Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions</li>
</ol>

<p>• Transferring files to MSWorks takes longer than other pro-grams like AppleWorks. This is a problem with MSWorks—all pastes take longer, regardless of whether it is TurboTransfer or the user doing the paste.</p>

<p>• If the Clipboard is empty when MSWord starts up—such as when you first start a Macintosh—all you will get is a “Beep” when you try to transfer from the AlphaSmart 3000. This hap-pens when the Paste command is disabled—a bug in how MSWord handles the Clipboard when it is empty. To solve this, copy something into the Clipboard before you launch MSWord. An easy fix is to go to the Scrapbook under the Apple menu and</p>

<p>copy (x-C or ctrl-C ) anything there. You can also try the transfer (nothing happens), quit out of MSWord, and then re-launch the application. The transfer will work.</p>

<p>With proper care and maintenance, you will be able to enjoy your AlphaSmart 3000 for a very long time.</p>

<h1 id="safety-care-and-maintenance">Safety, Care, and Maintenance</h1>

<p>With proper care and maintenance, your AlphaSmart 3000 will give you years of worry-free service. The following tips will help you keep your AlphaSmart 3000 in top condition:</p>

<p>• The AlphaSmart 3000 will turn off automatically when it is idle for more than x minutes (the time is user-adjustable, and can vary from 4 (default) to 59 minutes).</p>

<p>• Always turn off your AlphaSmart 3000 before changing the batter-ies or connecting to an AC adapter.</p>

<p>• Take care not to break the LCD screen. Don’t drop the AlphaSmart 3000 or subject it to strong impact. Do not place an AC adapter or other heavy object over the LCD screen.</p>

<p>• Keep your AlphaSmart 3000 away from extreme heat. Don’t leave it on the dashboard or in the trunk of a car, or near a heater.</p>

<p>• Don’t leave your AlphaSmart 3000 in a place that is extremely dusty or damp.</p>

<p>• Do not use frayed or damaged cables.</p>

<p>• Never force a connector into a port if the connector and port do not join easily.</p>

<p>• Clean the screen only with a soft dry cloth. Do not use solvents. 70 AlphaSmart 3000 Maintenance and Safety Guidelines</p>

<p>Although a matter of some debate, there are studies that suggest the following may be responsible for certain physical injuries: Typing for extended periods, improper positioning of your body while using a computing device, poor work habits, and/or individual health problems. Physical injuries could include carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and tenosynovitis. The warning signs of these injuries often occur after some injury has been suffered. The following may be symptomatic of this type of physical injury:</p>

<p>• Lack of feeling in the area</p>

<p>• A hot, burning feeling inside the area</p>

<p>• Tingling</p>

<p>• Throbbing</p>

<p>• Stiffness and/or aching In particular, watch for these symptoms in the hands, wrists, arms or neck. These symptoms may not occur during your use of the AlphaSmart 3000, or occur during times when work has not been performed for some time. In the event that these symptoms occur or you experience any other physical difficulties (including pain, stiffness or aching) that you think may be related, you should contact your doctor promptly. Caution: Please note that there may be a risk of physical injury due to improper use of your AlphaSmart 3000. In order to help reduce this risk of physical injury, read and follow the instructions in this section. The remainder of this section provides further safety information and advice about setting up your workstation, using proper posture, and using proper work habits.</p>

<p>Work Environment</p>

<p>Several factors may affect your ability to work in a comfortable and productive environment. By following the recommendations described AlphaSmart 3000 71</p>

<p>below, it should help you achieve such an environment and minimize the risk of physical stress that may cause injury.</p>

<p>Positioning of the AlphaSmart 3000</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 should be located in front of you and at a comfortable distance so that your arms and hands are resting in a relaxed and ready position at your sides. Choose a work area that can accommodate your AlphaSmart 3000 and any additional materials.</p>

<p>Furniture and Posture</p>

<p>Adjust your workstation to be physically comfortable and to allow your body to work in a relaxed and efficient manner. If your table and/or chair is adjustable, adjust the height and angle so that your forearms and wrists are straight and parallel to the floor, and your feet are flat on the floor (use a footrest if necessary). The back of your chair should be adjusted to support your lower back while working. Position your chair to avoid undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near your knee and the backs of your lower legs. In working, you should use a comfortable, upright position. Try not to lean forward, backward, or to the side while working. Materials should be within reach and frequently needed materials should not be located in an area where a twisting motion is required.</p>

<p>Hand and Arm Position and Motion</p>

<p>In using your AlphaSmart 3000, you should keep a relaxed, comfortable position that follows the suggestions discussed in this section. While working, your elbows may lightly touch your sides, but should not exert pressure against your body. Your wrists should be in a comfortable, straight position. Try not to arch or bend your wrists while typing as this may place strain on your wrists. Rest your hands on a palm rest or on the table (if you do not have a palm rest). When typing, use a minimum degree of force and avoid hitting the keys with more force than necessary.</p>

<p>Lighting</p>

<p>Like your workstation and posture, your lighting should be adjusted to accommodate your use of the AlphaSmart 3000. Adjust the lighting sources, 72 AlphaSmart 3000 Maintenance and Safety Guidelines</p>

<p>shades, drapes, or blinds so that glare on the screen is minimal, while still allowing comfortable viewing of the materials around you. You should use several lighting sources to accommodate different tasks, such as overhead lighting for viewing your AlphaSmart 3000 and the overall workstation area, and more focused lighting for closer desktop tasks.</p>

<p>Vision Care</p>

<p>Vision care is important, particularly if you are working for extended periods of time. Your eyes may become irritated and fatigued. Resting your eyes at regular intervals and keeping your glasses, lenses, and display clean should reduce the strain on your eyes. Also, it is advisable to have regular eye check-ups by a vision care specialist.</p>

<p>Work Habits</p>

<p>General work habits are an important part of working in a comfortable, relaxed, and efficient manner. Take note of your work habits and positions during the day. Try not to work for extended periods of time on a single task. By shifting between several tasks you change the physical demands placed upon you. In changing tasks, adjust your posture somewhat to avoid extended strain on certain muscles. Try to take several breaks during the day to stretch and exercise.</p>

<p>Health Habits and Exercise</p>

<p>Your existing health conditions can affect your ability to work in a comfortable manner. Health conditions which may make it difficult to work and may place undue stress upon your body include: Diabetes, excessive weight, hypertension, smoking, stress, arthritis or other inflammatory disease, and conditions affecting hormone levels (including pregnancy and menopause). Each individual has a threshold level of physical stress that they can comfortable and efficiently work under without harm. However, it is important to keep track of your physical well-being and to avoid exceeding your threshold. If you have any of the above mentioned physical conditions, you should regularly and carefully keep track of how you feel as you work. AlphaSmart 3000 73 Radio and Television Interference</p>

<h4 id="additional-notes">Additional Notes</h4>

<ol>
  <li>If the motherboard originally had an Android system, the first flash must be done by forcing entry into Mask ROM mode.<br />
<em>(If the forced software method fails, use hardware by shorting the designated test point on the motherboard to enter Mask ROM.)</em></li>
  <li>Flashing in Mask ROM mode is generally required only if the motherboard previously ran an Android system.</li>
