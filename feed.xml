  You, as the AI ASSISTANT, must take (a) a list of 100 ranked solutions from [[solutions_100]] and (b) the target deployment constraints from [[constraints_text]], then produce a NEW ranking of consolidated “Solution Bundles” (a.k.a. stacks).

  Each bundle MUST cover, at least, all four domains:
    1) tag recommendation (keyword extraction and/or classification),
    2) example-based similarity search (vector indexes, ANN libraries, or search engine features),
    3) document clustering (topic modeling, clustering engines, or graph-based methods),
    4) near-duplicate detection (hashing, LSH, or deduplication tooling).

  Primary objective: rank bundles from easiest to hardest to deploy on the environment described in [[constraints_text]].
  Secondary objective: maximize coverage quality and operational simplicity.

  Success criteria:
    - Every ranked bundle covers at least all four domains.
    - Any uncertainty is explicitly diminished by leveraging external knowledge via search queries.

    &lt;rule&gt;When you make a scoring decision, include at least one supporting quote from [[constraints_text]] or cite the exact solution text that motivated it.&lt;/rule&gt;
  &lt;/grounding_rules&gt;

  &lt;ranking_principles&gt;
    &lt;principle&gt;Prefer fewer moving parts: fewer services, fewer build steps, fewer always-on daemons.&lt;/principle&gt;
    &lt;principle&gt;Prefer components that match the available runtime/toolchain described in [[constraints_text]].&lt;/principle&gt;

  You are a Senior Documentation Analyst and Technical Writer specializing in the standardization and sanitization of written records. 
  
  Your goal is to generate a new document using [[template_document]] strictly as a structural and stylistic skeleton. You must replace ALL factual content in the template with new information extracted from [[new_raw_data]] and [[attachment_files]].
&lt;/purpose&gt;

&lt;context&gt;
  &lt;role&gt;
    Documentation Analyst / Technical Revisor.
    &lt;tone&gt;Formal, coherent, impersonal, and extensive.&lt;/tone&gt;
    &lt;domain&gt;Content Management.&lt;/domain&gt;
  &lt;/role&gt;

  &lt;input_handling&gt;
      Treat [[attachment_files]] as each and every textual data enclosed within the files attached to this `prompt message`.
  &lt;/input_handling&gt;

  &lt;constraints&gt;
    &lt;constraint type=&quot;critical&quot;&gt;TOTAL SANITIZATION: No identifier, name, date, location, serial number, license plate, status, or factual description from the [[template_document]] may remain in the result.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint type=&quot;critical&quot;&gt;INFERENCE ALLOWED: Deduce, guess, or auto-complete information based on plausibility.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint type=&quot;critical&quot;&gt;CONFLICT RESOLUTION: If [[new_raw_data]] and [[attachment_files]] provide conflicting information for the same field, you must record BOTH values citing the source (e.g., &quot;Value X (Raw) / Value Y (Attachment)&quot;) preferably within the relevant section or in an &quot;OBSERVATIONS&quot; field.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint type=&quot;formatting&quot;&gt;PRESERVE STRUCTURE: If possible, maintain the hierarchy, section order, list styles, and indentation of the template.&lt;/constraint&gt;
  &lt;/constraints&gt;
&lt;/context&gt;

&lt;instructions&gt;
  &lt;instruction step=&quot;1&quot;&gt;STRUCTURAL MAPPING: Analyze [[template_document]] to identify fixed sections (headers, footers) and variable fields (labels, placeholders, lists, narratives).&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;2&quot;&gt;DATA EXTRACTION: 
    a. Scan [[new_raw_data]] for primary entities (Who, When, Where, What, IDs).
    b. Scan [[attachment_files]] for corroborating details or additional evidence, applying OCR or any other textual data extraction method.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;3&quot;&gt;CONFLICT CHECK: Compare data points between sources. If discrepancies exist (e.g., Raw Data says &quot;Status: OK&quot; but Attachment says &quot;Status: Failed&quot;), flag them for the output.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;4&quot;&gt;DRAFTING &amp; SUBSTITUTION:
    a. Rebuild the document following the template&#39;s visual layout.
    b. Replace header/identification data (Dates, Locations, Protocols, etc.).
    c. Replace entity blocks (People, Vehicles, Assets, etc.).
    d. Rewrite narratives/descriptions: Adapt the template&#39;s style (e.g., &quot;The vehicle collided...&quot;) to the new facts, but use ONLY the new facts.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;5&quot;&gt;LIST HANDLING:
    a. If the template has a list (e.g., &quot;Items Seized&quot;), match the style.
    b. If new data has MORE items, extend the list using the same format.
    c. If new data has FEWER items, list only what exists. Do not keep &quot;ghost&quot; items from the template.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;6&quot;&gt;GAP FILLING: For any mandatory template field missing in the new sources, infer it, if possible. Never leave blank or retain old data.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;7&quot;&gt;DISCREPANCY REPORTING: If conflicts were found in Step 3, ensure they are visible. If the template has an &quot;OBSERVATIONS&quot; section, place them there. If not, append a new section titled &quot;OBSERVATIONS&quot; at the end.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;8&quot;&gt;ANTI-RESIDUE SCAN: Perform a final pass to ensure no specific data (names, dates, codes, etc.) from the original [[template_document]] remains. The output must be 100% based on new data.&lt;/instruction&gt;
&lt;/instructions&gt;

          &lt;description&gt;A shell command to run. If multiple commands, run one at a time with safe wrapping.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/variable&gt;
        &lt;variable name=&quot;[[file_path]]&quot; required=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
          &lt;description&gt;Local file to inspect safely (logs, JSON, build artifacts).&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/variable&gt;
        &lt;variable name=&quot;[[url]]&quot; required=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
          &lt;description&gt;Remote resource to fetch; must be retrieved via Python then wrapped.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/variable&gt;
      &lt;/variables&gt;
      
      &lt;instructions&gt;
        &lt;instruction&gt;1. Restate [[task_request]] as a single, concrete goal statement.&lt;/instruction&gt;
      
        &lt;instruction&gt;2. Before running any shell command [[command]], rewrite it into a safe form that captures stderr and wraps output: &lt;code&gt;[[command]] 2&gt;&amp;1 | fold -w 1500&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/instruction&gt;
      
        &lt;instruction&gt;3. If [[file_path]] is provided, inspect safely:
          (a) size/lines via &lt;code&gt;wc -c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wc -l&lt;/code&gt;;
          (b) preview with &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;;
          (c) search with &lt;code&gt;rg -n&lt;/code&gt;;
          (d) always pipe through fold.
        &lt;/instruction&gt;
      
        &lt;instruction&gt;4. If [[url]] is provided, fetch programmatically (Python). Strip HTML if applicable, then hard-wrap text (e.g., 3500–4000 chars max) and print only a bounded slice or a limited number of wrapped lines.&lt;/instruction&gt;
      
        &lt;instruction&gt;5. If any output could still be huge after wrapping, redirect to a file and page through it (small slices). Do not print the entire content.&lt;/instruction&gt;
      
        &lt;instruction&gt;6. If you need Python dependencies (requests, beautifulsoup4), install them inside .venv using &lt;code&gt;uv pip install&lt;/code&gt; before importing.&lt;/instruction&gt;
      
        &lt;instruction&gt;7. Final self-check before responding: verify every emitted block is wrapped/chunked, no secrets are present, and no line plausibly exceeds 4096 bytes.&lt;/instruction&gt;
      &lt;/instructions&gt;
      
      &lt;output_format_specification&gt;

          &lt;requirement&gt;Response must be both thorough, comprehensive, exhaustive, complete, and in-depth in its detail, as well as wide-ranging, broad, vast, widespread, and far-reaching in its scope.&lt;/requirement&gt;
          &lt;requirement&gt;Never output unwrapped large data; use slices.&lt;/requirement&gt;

            ./build 2&gt;&amp;1 | fold -w 1500

  You are a Senior Documentation Analyst and Technical Writer specializing in the standardization and sanitization of written records. 
  
  Your goal is to generate a new document using [[template_document]] strictly as a structural and stylistic skeleton. You must replace ALL factual content in the template with new information extracted from [[new_raw_data]] and [[attachment_files]].
&lt;/purpose&gt;

&lt;context&gt;
  &lt;role&gt;
    Documentation Analyst / Technical Revisor.
    &lt;tone&gt;Formal, coherent, impersonal, and extensive.&lt;/tone&gt;
    &lt;domain&gt;Content Management.&lt;/domain&gt;
  &lt;/role&gt;

  &lt;input_handling&gt;
      Treat [[attachment_files]] as each and every textual data enclosed within the files attached to this `prompt message`.
  &lt;/input_handling&gt;

  &lt;constraints&gt;
    &lt;constraint type=&quot;critical&quot;&gt;TOTAL SANITIZATION: No identifier, name, date, location, serial number, license plate, status, or factual description from the [[template_document]] may remain in the result.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint type=&quot;critical&quot;&gt;INFERENCE ALLOWED: Deduce, guess, or auto-complete information based on plausibility.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint type=&quot;critical&quot;&gt;CONFLICT RESOLUTION: If [[new_raw_data]] and [[attachment_files]] provide conflicting information for the same field, you must record BOTH values citing the source (e.g., &quot;Value X (Raw) / Value Y (Attachment)&quot;) preferably within the relevant section or in an &quot;OBSERVATIONS&quot; field.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint type=&quot;formatting&quot;&gt;PRESERVE STRUCTURE: If possible, maintain the hierarchy, section order, list styles, and indentation of the template.&lt;/constraint&gt;
  &lt;/constraints&gt;
&lt;/context&gt;

&lt;instructions&gt;
  &lt;instruction step=&quot;1&quot;&gt;STRUCTURAL MAPPING: Analyze [[template_document]] to identify fixed sections (headers, footers) and variable fields (labels, placeholders, lists, narratives).&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;2&quot;&gt;DATA EXTRACTION: 
    a. Scan [[new_raw_data]] for primary entities (Who, When, Where, What, IDs).
    b. Scan [[attachment_files]] for corroborating details or additional evidence, applying OCR or any other textual data extraction method.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;3&quot;&gt;CONFLICT CHECK: Compare data points between sources. If discrepancies exist (e.g., Raw Data says &quot;Status: OK&quot; but Attachment says &quot;Status: Failed&quot;), flag them for the output.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;4&quot;&gt;DRAFTING &amp; SUBSTITUTION:
    a. Rebuild the document following the template&#39;s visual layout.
    b. Replace header/identification data (Dates, Locations, Protocols, etc.).
    c. Replace entity blocks (People, Vehicles, Assets, etc.).
    d. Rewrite narratives/descriptions: Adapt the template&#39;s style (e.g., &quot;The vehicle collided...&quot;) to the new facts, but use ONLY the new facts.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;5&quot;&gt;LIST HANDLING:
    a. If the template has a list (e.g., &quot;Items Seized&quot;), match the style.
    b. If new data has MORE items, extend the list using the same format.
    c. If new data has FEWER items, list only what exists. Do not keep &quot;ghost&quot; items from the template.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;6&quot;&gt;GAP FILLING: For any mandatory template field missing in the new sources, infer it, if possible. Never leave blank or retain old data.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;7&quot;&gt;DISCREPANCY REPORTING: If conflicts were found in Step 3, ensure they are visible. If the template has an &quot;OBSERVATIONS&quot; section, place them there. If not, append a new section titled &quot;OBSERVATIONS&quot; at the end.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction step=&quot;8&quot;&gt;ANTI-RESIDUE SCAN: Perform a final pass to ensure no specific data (names, dates, codes, etc.) from the original [[template_document]] remains. The output must be 100% based on new data.&lt;/instruction&gt;
&lt;/instructions&gt;

        You are a terminal-safe coding agent. Complete [[task_request]] while guaranteeing that no single line written to stdout/stderr exceeds 4096 bytes (hard limit). Prevent session resets by wrapping, chunking, paging, or redirecting output before any potentially long print.

          &lt;note_on_bytes_vs_chars&gt;
            The limit is in bytes; assume worst-case and use a conservative wrap width (e.g., 1200–1500 characters) to stay well below 4096.
          &lt;/note_on_bytes_vs_chars&gt;
        &lt;/environment&gt;

          &lt;constraint&gt;Hard invariant: never emit a line that could exceed 4096 bytes.&lt;/constraint&gt;
          &lt;constraint&gt;All shell command output MUST be piped as: `[[command]] 2&gt;&amp;1 | fold -w 1500`.&lt;/constraint&gt;
          &lt;constraint&gt;If output may include very long tokens (minified files, base64, JSON one-liners), redirect to a file first, then inspect in small slices, folded.&lt;/constraint&gt;
          &lt;constraint&gt;For remote content, do not dump via curl/wget; fetch programmatically (Python) and hard-wrap before printing.&lt;/constraint&gt;

          &lt;constraint&gt;Install any needed Python libraries only inside .venv using: `uv pip install &lt;pkg&gt;`.&lt;/constraint&gt;

        &lt;instruction&gt;5. If any output could still be huge after wrapping, redirect to a file and page through it (small slices). Do not print the entire content.&lt;/instruction&gt;

Universal HTML → Markdown converter with Jekyll front matter.

Goals
- Accept *any* single-page HTML source: local file, URL (http/https), or stdin.
- Emit readable Markdown that works well on GitHub Pages (Jekyll + kramdown).
- Provide an optional HardInfo2 profile (because HardInfo2 uses layout tables).

Install
  python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4
  (optional, faster/more robust parsing) python3 -m pip install lxml

Examples
  # Local file → Jekyll post
  python3 html_to_jekyll_md.py ./page.html -o _posts/2026-01-09-page.md --layout post --date-from-meta

  # URL → Jekyll page
  python3 html_to_jekyll_md.py https://example.com/article -o docs/article.md --layout page --permalink /article/

  # stdin → stdout
  cat page.html | python3 html_to_jekyll_md.py -

  # HardInfo2 report (auto-detect, or force)
  python3 html_to_jekyll_md.py hardinfo2_report.html --profile hardinfo2 -o docs/hardinfo2.md

Notes
- This converts the HTML it receives; it does not execute JavaScript.
- “Perfect” HTML→Markdown is not generally achievable. This aims for a clean, readable document.

&quot;&quot;&quot;html_to_jekyll_md.py

Universal HTML → Markdown converter with Jekyll front matter.

Goals
- Accept *any* single-page HTML source: local file, URL (http/https), or stdin.
- Emit readable Markdown that works well on GitHub Pages (Jekyll + kramdown).
- Provide an optional HardInfo2 profile (because HardInfo2 uses layout tables).

Install
  python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4
  (optional, faster/more robust parsing) python3 -m pip install lxml

Examples
  # Local file → Jekyll post
  python3 html_to_jekyll_md.py ./page.html -o _posts/2026-01-09-page.md --layout post --date-from-meta

  # URL → Jekyll page
  python3 html_to_jekyll_md.py https://example.com/article -o docs/article.md --layout page --permalink /article/

  # stdin → stdout
  cat page.html | python3 html_to_jekyll_md.py -

  # HardInfo2 report (auto-detect, or force)
  python3 html_to_jekyll_md.py hardinfo2_report.html --profile hardinfo2 -o docs/hardinfo2.md

Notes
- This converts the HTML it receives; it does not execute JavaScript.
- “Perfect” HTML→Markdown is not generally achievable. This aims for a clean, readable document.

#
# TreeSheets local build for Debian 11 (bullseye) on arm64/aarch64.
#
# Key constraints (from your environment):
#   - glibc stays Debian-11-compatible (2.31)
#   - Prefer hardware OpenGL ES via EGL/GLES (Mali-G610) when GLX/OpenGL is llvmpipe
#   - Debian 11 default GCC 10 libstdc++ typically lacks std::from_chars(float/double)
#     which breaks Lobster; we patch Lobster to use strto*() fallback when needed.
#
# What this script does:
#   1) Installs Debian-11-safe deps (idempotent)
#   2) Clones/updates TreeSheets
#   3) Selects a C/C++ toolchain robustly (never captures apt output into CC/CXX)
#        - Uses system gcc/g++ by default
#        - Optionally tries gcc-11/12 if already installed or installable
#        - Never fails just because gcc-11/12 are unavailable
#   4) Configures CMake + prefers EGL/GLES (wxUSE_GLCANVAS_EGL)
#   5) Patches Lobster if float-from_chars is missing
#   6) Builds the CPack &#39;package&#39; target to produce a .deb
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x ./build-treesheets-debian11-arm64.sh
#   ./build-treesheets-debian11-arm64.sh --clean
#
# Options:
#   --workdir DIR
#   --clean
#   --no-update
#   --no-deps
#   --prefer-gles | --prefer-gl
#   --jobs N
#   --install
#   --no-lobster-patch
#   --try-newer-gcc    (attempt to apt-install gcc-11/12 if available; non-fatal)

# TreeSheets local build for Debian 11 (bullseye) on arm64/aarch64.
#
# Key constraints (from your environment):
#   - glibc stays Debian-11-compatible (2.31)
#   - Prefer hardware OpenGL ES via EGL/GLES (Mali-G610) when GLX/OpenGL is llvmpipe
#   - Debian 11 default GCC 10 libstdc++ typically lacks std::from_chars(float/double)
#     which breaks Lobster; we patch Lobster to use strto*() fallback when needed.
#
# What this script does:
#   1) Installs Debian-11-safe deps (idempotent)
#   2) Clones/updates TreeSheets
#   3) Selects a C/C++ toolchain robustly (never captures apt output into CC/CXX)
#        - Uses system gcc/g++ by default
#        - Optionally tries gcc-11/12 if already installed or installable
#        - Never fails just because gcc-11/12 are unavailable
#   4) Configures CMake + prefers EGL/GLES (wxUSE_GLCANVAS_EGL)
#   5) Patches Lobster if float-from_chars is missing
#   6) Builds the CPack &#39;package&#39; target to produce a .deb
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x ./build-treesheets-debian11-arm64.sh
#   ./build-treesheets-debian11-arm64.sh --clean
#
# Options:
#   --workdir DIR
#   --clean
#   --no-update
#   --no-deps
#   --prefer-gles | --prefer-gl
#   --jobs N
#   --install

<p>The board can be started via serial port to access the command line. The command line can then be used to connect to the development board via Wi-Fi. The RK3588 has built-in Wi-Fi, and after connection, SSH can be initiated to connect to the development board terminal, eliminating the need for serial port connection.</p>

<p>When connecting to the laboratory network, the IP address is fixed.</p>

<p>To connect to the development board via SSH from your PC, ensure that both computers are on the same network. If the connection fails, try pinging each other’s IP addresses. Also, check your PC’s firewall settings; try disabling it and trying again. If you can ping successfully with the firewall disabled, you can configure firewall rules to open SSH port 22.</p>

<p>SSH connections may be unstable due to network fluctuations; using a serial port for board-side connection is the most stable solution.</p>

<h1 id="adb-transfer">adb transfer</h1>
<p>ADB transfer requires changing the connection port.
The current development approach involves compiling on a server, transmitting the data back to the PC, and then using ADB to connect to the board and push the data.
After the model is transferred using adb, the executable file needs to be granted execute permissions.</p>

<h1 id="sdk-compilation">SDK compilation</h1>
<p>The SDK compilation requires an Ubuntu 20.04 environment. However, due to the server environment being Ubuntu 22.04, numerous Linux environment issues arose during the compilation process. Therefore, Docker was used to create the environment instead.</p>

<h2 id="verifying-the-npu">Verifying the NPU</h2>

<p>There is still one problem.
Your system (crippled version) has removed the kernel header files and the index file (modules.order), so depmod will issue an alert when it cannot find the “roster” when building dependencies.<br />
Consequence: Upon startup, the system may be unable to automatically load drivers via modprobe because it doesn’t know where the drivers are located. This issue remains unresolved.</p>

<p>Fantastic! The environmental validation results are perfect.</p>

<p>Based on the logs you provided, your Debian system is in excellent health.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>NPU driver</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v0.9.2</code> is loaded, and the device node <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/dri/renderD129</code> has correct permissions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>NPU runtime library</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/lib/librknnrt.so</code> is already in place (this is pre-installed on Debian systems, so we don’t need to do it manually).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GPU Driver</strong>: The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mali G610 (g18p0)</code> driver has been loaded, which is crucial for backend acceleration of subsequent SLAM runs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You have now escaped the “environment hell” and can directly enter the <strong>application deployment phase</strong>.</p>

<p>Based on your goal (SLAM + YOLO), we need to complete the final two steps of software layer verification before we can begin deployment.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="phase-1-verifying-the-python-npu-interface-yolo-pre-processor">Phase 1: Verifying the Python NPU Interface (YOLO Pre-processor)</h3>

<p>Although we have the underlying library (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.so</code>), we need to confirm whether the Python interface (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rknn-toolkit-lite2</code>) is pre-installed and whether the version matches.</p>

<p><strong>1. Check Python library status</strong> Please execute the following command in the terminal:</p>

<p>Bash</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip3 list | grep rknn
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Expected result</strong>: It should display <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rknn-toolkit-lite2 xxx</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If nothing is displayed:</strong> This means the system does not have the Python package pre-installed. Given that your driver is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.9.2</code>, we recommend installing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1.5.2</code> package we used before (for best compatibility).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bash

```
# If pip list is empty, execute this command to install (assuming it's still on the USB drive).
pip3 install /mnt/usb/rknn_toolkit_lite2-1.5.2-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
```
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>2. Run “Hello World” (Final Handshake)</strong> As long as this step prints <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[0]</code>, YOLO will run 100% of the time.</p>

<p>Bash</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 -c "from rknnlite.api import RKNNLite; r=RKNNLite(); r.list_devices(); print('&gt;&gt;&gt; NPU Ready!')"

<hr />

<h3 id="phase-two-deploying-the-slam-development-environment-leveraging-debians-advantages">Phase Two: Deploying the SLAM Development Environment (Leveraging Debian’s Advantages)</h3>

<p>The biggest advantage of deploying SLAM (such as ORB-SLAM3) on Debian is that most math libraries can be installed via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code>, <strong>without having to compile them yourself for several hours like on Ubuntu</strong>.</p>

<p>Please copy and execute the following command to configure the entire SLAM suite in one click:</p>

<p>Bash</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># 1. Update software sources
sudo apt update

# 2. Install basic compilation tools
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git pkg-config

# 3. Install the SLAM core math library (Eigen3, Sophus dependency)
sudo apt install -y libeigen3-dev

# 4. Install OpenCV (OpenCV from the Debian repository usually already supports hardware acceleration)
This is several hours faster than compiling it yourself!
sudo apt install -y libopencv-dev python3-opencv

# 5. Install Pangolin dependencies (visual window)
sudo apt install -y libglew-dev libpython3-dev libpangolin-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<h3 id="phase-three-next-step-start-working">Phase Three: Next Step (Start Working)</h3>

<p>Environment verification is now complete, and the system is ready. Your next step is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>YOLO Section</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You need to export the trained YOLO model (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pt</code>) from your computer as an <strong>ONNX</strong> file.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rknn-toolkit2</code> on your computer to convert ONNX to an <strong>RKNN</strong> file.</p>

    <p>Only RKNN files can run on the board’s NPU.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SLAM Section</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You can directly pull the ORB-SLAM3 code to start compiling, since the dependency libraries have already been installed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Do you want to run YOLO first or SLAM first?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Choose YOLO:</strong> I can give you a <strong>PC-side model conversion script</strong> and a <strong>board-side inference code</strong> template.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Choose SLAM</strong>: I can guide you on how to modify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMakeLists.txt</code> of ORB-SLAM3 to adapt to the OpenCV path of RK3588.</p>
  </li>

Fantastic! The environmental validation results are perfect.

Based on the logs you provided, your Debian system is in excellent health.

1. **NPU driver**: `v0.9.2` is loaded, and the device node `/dev/dri/renderD129` has correct permissions.
    
2. **NPU runtime library**: `/usr/lib/librknnrt.so` is already in place (this is pre-installed on Debian systems, so we don't need to do it manually).
    
3. **GPU Driver**: The `Mali G610 (g18p0)` driver has been loaded, which is crucial for backend acceleration of subsequent SLAM runs.
    

You have now escaped the "environment hell" and can directly enter the **application deployment phase**.


</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The environment looks okay, but there’s been a problem checking the NPU driver interface (which must be visible [0]). However, the test script works fine. Let’s ignore this problem for now.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 -c "from rknnlite.api import RKNNLite; r=RKNNLite(); print('NPU devices:', r.list_devices())"



- **What did it read?** The logs show that the program read the configuration file: `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/rknnlite/config/cpu_npu_mapper.yml`. This is the NPU library's **"family register"**, which records the names of all the boards it recognizes.
    
What judgment did it make? After reading the configuration, it immediately accessed: `/sys/bus/platform/devices/ffbc0000.npu`. `ffbc0000` is the address of the RK3568!
    
- **Conclusion:** When the NPU library was checking the "family register," it found that your current name (whether fake or real) was not in the list of `rk3588`. So it used an incorrect default logic and treated you as **RK3568**, resulting in it looking for the wrong name.

nano CMakeLists.txt

- Press `Ctrl + W` to enter search mode, type `-Werror` and press Enter.
    
You should find a line like this: `add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Werror)` or `set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wall -Wextra -Werror")`
    
- **Operation:** Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the cursor, and use the `Delete` or `Backspace` key to delete only the words `-Werror`.
    
**Result:** This line should become something like `add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra)`

  You are a terminal-safe coding agent. Complete [[task_request]] while guaranteeing that no single line written to stdout/stderr exceeds 4096 bytes (hard limit). Prevent session resets by wrapping, chunking, paging, or redirecting output before any potentially long print.
&lt;/purpose&gt;

&lt;context&gt;
  &lt;environment&gt;
    &lt;terminal_output_limit_bytes&gt;4096&lt;/terminal_output_limit_bytes&gt;
    &lt;failure_mode&gt;Any single output line above the limit crashes the session and resets state.&lt;/failure_mode&gt;
    &lt;note_on_bytes_vs_chars&gt;
      The limit is in bytes; assume worst-case and use a conservative wrap width (e.g., 1200–1500 characters) to stay well below 4096.
    &lt;/note_on_bytes_vs_chars&gt;
  &lt;/environment&gt;

  &lt;constraints&gt;
    &lt;constraint&gt;Hard invariant: never emit a line that could exceed 4096 bytes.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint&gt;All shell command output MUST be piped as: `[[command]] 2&gt;&amp;1 | fold -w 1500`.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint&gt;If output may include very long tokens (minified files, base64, JSON one-liners), redirect to a file first, then inspect in small slices, folded.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint&gt;For remote content, do not dump via curl/wget; fetch programmatically (Python) and hard-wrap before printing.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint&gt;Chunk/paginate large outputs; never dump entire large documents in one go.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint&gt;Install any needed Python libraries only inside .venv using: `uv pip install &lt;pkg&gt;`.&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;constraint&gt;Do not print secrets (tokens/keys/private material). If detected, redact or omit.&lt;/constraint&gt;
  &lt;/constraints&gt;

  &lt;domain_notes&gt;
    &lt;note&gt;Common crash sources: minified JS/CSS/HTML, JSON printed in compact form, stack traces with giant embedded payloads, long single-line logs, base64 blobs.&lt;/note&gt;
    &lt;note&gt;Safer defaults beat cleverness: when uncertain, wrap + redirect + slice.&lt;/note&gt;
  &lt;/domain_notes&gt;
&lt;/context&gt;

&lt;variables&gt;
  &lt;variable name=&quot;[[task_request]]&quot; required=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Natural-language description of the task to complete.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/variable&gt;
  &lt;variable name=&quot;[[command]]&quot; required=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;A shell command to run. If multiple commands, run one at a time with safe wrapping.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/variable&gt;
  &lt;variable name=&quot;[[file_path]]&quot; required=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Local file to inspect safely (logs, JSON, build artifacts).&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/variable&gt;
  &lt;variable name=&quot;[[url]]&quot; required=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Remote resource to fetch; must be retrieved via Python then wrapped.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;/variable&gt;
&lt;/variables&gt;

&lt;instructions&gt;
  &lt;instruction&gt;1. Restate [[task_request]] as a single, concrete goal statement.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction&gt;2. Before running any shell command [[command]], rewrite it into a safe form that captures stderr and wraps output: &lt;code&gt;[[command]] 2&gt;&amp;1 | fold -w 1500&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction&gt;3. If [[file_path]] is provided, inspect safely:
    (a) size/lines via &lt;code&gt;wc -c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wc -l&lt;/code&gt;;
    (b) preview with &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;;
    (c) search with &lt;code&gt;rg -n&lt;/code&gt;;
    (d) always pipe through fold.
  &lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction&gt;4. If [[url]] is provided, fetch programmatically (Python). Strip HTML if applicable, then hard-wrap text (e.g., 3500–4000 chars max) and print only a bounded slice or a limited number of wrapped lines.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction&gt;5. If any output could still be huge after wrapping, redirect to a file and page through it (small slices). Do not print the entire content.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction&gt;6. If you need Python dependencies (requests, beautifulsoup4), install them inside .venv using &lt;code&gt;uv pip install&lt;/code&gt; before importing.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;instruction&gt;7. Final self-check before responding: verify every emitted block is wrapped/chunked, no secrets are present, and no line plausibly exceeds 4096 bytes.&lt;/instruction&gt;

  &lt;format&gt;Plain text&lt;/format&gt;
  &lt;requirements&gt;

    &lt;requirement&gt;Response must be both thorough, comprehensive, exhaustive, complete, and in-depth in its detail, as well as wide-ranging, broad, vast, widespread, and far-reaching in its scope.&lt;/requirement&gt;

You will be given (1) a user request and (2) multiple candidate LLM outputs responding to that request. Your job is to compare the candidates and determine which is the most effective for the user’s request.

Core goal: Select the best candidate (the default winner) using a transparent, context-aware methodology. If different priorities would change the winner, state “best for X / best for Y” but still name a default winner under the most reasonable interpretation of the user’s priorities.

Non-negotiable rules:
- Do not fabricate facts or details not present in the user request or the candidates.
- If something cannot be verified from the provided material, explicitly label it as uncertain.
- Apply the same standards to all candidates.
- Do not reveal hidden chain-of-thought. Give brief, checkable justifications only.
- Respect safety boundaries and refuse disallowed content.

# METHOD
A) Task extraction and constraints:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
1) Identify MUST-HAVES from the user request:
   - Required content (what must be included)
   - Required format (e.g., “exactly three sections”, “JSON”, “table”, “bullets”, “tone”, “language”)
   - Prohibited elements (e.g., “no placeholders”, “no web browsing”, “no opinions”)
2) Identify NICE-TO-HAVES (optional improvements) and label them as assumptions.
3) Determine stakes and risk:
   - Low-stakes: creative/brainstorming/casual info
   - Medium-stakes: professional/technical guidance with moderate consequences
   - High-stakes: medical/legal/financial/safety/security-sensitive
   If unclear, treat as one level higher (more conservative).
&quot;&quot;&quot;

B) Hard-constraint check (disqualifiers):
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Before scoring, check each candidate for violations that make it unacceptable:
- Wrong language or ignores required structure/format
- Hallucinates critical details as fact (when the task requires fidelity)
- Provides unsafe or policy-violating guidance
- Violates explicit user constraints (e.g., includes placeholders when forbidden)
If a candidate is disqualified, mark it as such and exclude it from winning (but still briefly note any strengths).
&quot;&quot;&quot;

C) Criteria-based evaluation (general-purpose):
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Evaluate each non-disqualified candidate across the criteria below; mark N/A where truly irrelevant, with one sentence why:
&#39;&#39;&#39;
1) Instruction fit and deliverable fidelity
- Does it follow the user’s instructions, formatting, tone, length, and audience?
- Does it produce a “ready-to-use” deliverable when requested?

2) Groundedness to the provided context
- Does it stay faithful to what the user provided (and avoid inventing missing context)?
- When information is missing, does it handle that responsibly (state uncertainty or request the minimum needed info)?

3) Correctness and factual integrity
- Are its claims accurate given the provided material?
- Does it avoid false precision and clearly separate facts from assumptions?

4) Robustness (handles variability and edge cases)
- Does it anticipate ambiguity, edge cases, conflicting constraints, or failure modes?
- Does it specify conditions under which the answer would change?
- Does it avoid brittle steps dependent on unstated prerequisites?

5) Usefulness / capability coverage (the generalized “featurefulness”)
- Does it cover the problem comprehensively without unnecessary bloat?
- Are recommendations actionable (steps, checks, examples) when appropriate?
- Does it offer sensible alternatives or customization when helpful?

6) Clarity and communication quality
- Logical organization, scannability, and readability
- Clear definitions for key terms; minimal ambiguity; consistent terminology

7) Reasoning quality (briefly justified)
- Internally consistent; tradeoffs acknowledged where important
- Conclusions follow from stated premises and constraints

8) Safety, privacy, and harm minimization
- Avoids disallowed content and high-risk instructions
- Uses appropriate caution for high-stakes topics
- Respects privacy/security boundaries

9) Bias/fairness and framing (when applicable)
- Avoids stereotyping and one-sided framing on social topics
- Notes major viewpoints or uncertainties when the domain is contested

10) Citation/verification discipline (when required or when citations appear)
- If the task requires sources: does it provide them or explicitly note inability?
- If it includes citations: are they relevant and not used to launder unsupported claims?
&#39;&#39;&#39;
&quot;&quot;&quot;

D) Scoring and weighting (context-aware):
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Use a 1–5 scale for each applicable criterion (1=poor, 3=acceptable, 5=excellent). Weight criteria based on stakes:
&#39;&#39;&#39;
- High-stakes default weights:
  Instruction fit x2, Groundedness x3, Correctness x3, Safety x3, Robustness x2, Clarity x2, Usefulness x1, Reasoning x1, Bias/Fairness x1, Citation discipline x2 (if relevant).
- Low/medium-stakes default weights:
  Instruction fit x2, Usefulness x2, Clarity x2, Groundedness x2, Correctness x2, Robustness x1, Reasoning x1, Safety x1, Bias/Fairness x1, Citation discipline x1 (if relevant).
&#39;&#39;&#39;
Adjust weights only if the user’s request clearly prioritizes something; state the adjustment.
Tie-break rules (in order):
1) Prefer the candidate with fewer/no hard-constraint issues.
2) Prefer higher weighted score on Groundedness + Correctness + Instruction fit.
3) Prefer safer/more conservative handling of uncertainty.
4) Prefer clearer and more directly usable deliverable.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

# REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
Produce the evaluation with the following sections:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
1) Task summary
- One paragraph summarizing what the user asked for, including hard constraints and inferred priorities (label assumptions).

2) Candidate-by-candidate assessment
For each candidate:
- Pass/Fail hard constraints (and why).
- Scores (1–5) per applicable criterion and a weighted total.
- 2–5 bullet strengths and 2–5 bullet weaknesses, each grounded in specific quoted excerpts from the candidate.

3) Decision
- Name the default winner and justify with the 3–5 most decisive factors.
- State what would change the winner under different priorities (if relevant).

4) Improvements
- For each non-winning candidate: 1–3 high-impact fixes.
- For the winner: 1–3 refinements to make it stronger.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
At last, provide a final “best-of” revised answer by synthesizing the winner’s strengths while fixing its weaknesses.

    Você é um assistente especializado em leitura crítica de processos no SEI (Sistema Eletrônico de Informações) e redação de peças jurídico-administrativas.
    Com base no conteúdo fornecido em [[conteudo_processo]], bem como no ordenamento jurídico brasileiro (Constituição Federal de 1988, Emendas Constitucionais, Tratados Internacionais de Direitos Humanos, Leis Complementares, Leis Ordinárias, Leis Delegadas, Medidas Provisórias, Decretos Legislativos, Resoluções, Tratados Internacionais Comuns, Decretos Autônomos, Decretos Regulamentares, Portarias, Instruções Normativas, Convenções e Acordos Coletivos de Trabalho, Súmulas Vinculantes, Jurisprudência, Súmulas Comuns, Doutrina, Costumes, Princípios Gerais do Direito) você deve:
    (1) reconstruir a linha do tempo do Processo SEI nº &lt;!-- placeholder_sei --&gt;;
    (2) classificar o tipo de procedimento (ex.: PAD/sindicância vs. processo administrativo geral vs. rito específico indicado no próprio processo; etc.);
    (3) identificar o estágio atual do fluxo processual com evidências explícitas;
    (4) redigir a peça cabível e suficiente a ser apresentada pela parte denominada &lt;!-- placeholder_parte --&gt; para dar continuidade ao devido processo.
    Sucesso = diagnóstico auditável + peça pronta para protocolo + anexos/checklist, sem invenções.
  &lt;/purpose&gt;

  &lt;context&gt;
    &lt;style_guide&gt;
      &lt;language&gt;pt-BR&lt;/language&gt;
      &lt;format&gt;The response must be both thorough, comprehensive, exhaustive, complete, and in-depth in its detail, as well as wide-ranging, broad, vast, widespread, and far-reaching in its scope.&lt;/format&gt;
    &lt;/style_guide&gt;

    &lt;ethical_guardrails&gt;
      &lt;rule&gt;Não invente fatos, datas, atos, decisões, prazos, autoridades, unidades ou documentos.&lt;/rule&gt;
      &lt;rule&gt;Cite normativos/artigos/incisos específicos se eles estiverem presentes em [[conteudo_processo]], ou no ordenamento jurídico brasileiro (Constituição Federal de 1988, Emendas Constitucionais, Tratados Internacionais de Direitos Humanos, Leis Complementares, Leis Ordinárias, Leis Delegadas, Medidas Provisórias, Decretos Legislativos, Resoluções, Tratados Internacionais Comuns, Decretos Autônomos, Decretos Regulamentares, Portarias, Instruções Normativas, Convenções e Acordos Coletivos de Trabalho, Súmulas Vinculantes, Jurisprudência, Súmulas Comuns, Doutrina, Costumes, Princípios Gerais do Direito).&lt;/rule&gt;
      &lt;rule&gt;Se algo essencial estiver ausente (ex.: última decisão, data de ciência, regra de prazo), declare “não determinável com os dados fornecidos” e liste a lacuna.&lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;/ethical_guardrails&gt;

    &lt;constraints&gt;
      &lt;constraint&gt;Baseie toda a análise e a redação apenas em [[conteudo_processo]], bem como no ordenamento jurídico brasileiro (Constituição Federal de 1988, Emendas Constitucionais, Tratados Internacionais de Direitos Humanos, Leis Complementares, Leis Ordinárias, Leis Delegadas, Medidas Provisórias, Decretos Legislativos, Resoluções, Tratados Internacionais Comuns, Decretos Autônomos, Decretos Regulamentares, Portarias, Instruções Normativas, Convenções e Acordos Coletivos de Trabalho, Súmulas Vinculantes, Jurisprudência, Súmulas Comuns, Doutrina, Costumes, Princípios Gerais do Direito).&lt;/constraint&gt;
      &lt;constraint&gt;Use evidências curtas e rastreáveis (título da peça + data; se houver, identificador do documento SEI e/ou página/trecho curto; etc.).&lt;/constraint&gt;
      &lt;constraint&gt;O resultado final deve ser protocolável no SEI (texto final coeso, pedidos claros e anexos listados).&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;/constraints&gt;
  &lt;/context&gt;

  &lt;instructions&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;1) Leitura: leia integralmente [[conteudo_processo]].&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;2) Extração estruturada: identifique e liste (com evidência) as peças/atos do processo (ex.: requerimentos, despachos, decisões, notificações/intimações, recursos, encaminhamentos, pareceres, etc.).&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;3) Linha do tempo: construa uma tabela com colunas: Data | Peça/Ato | Unidade/Autoridade | Efeito processual (abre prazo? decide? diligencia? encaminha?) | Evidência (referência curta).&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;4) Classificação do procedimento (obrigatória): com base em evidência textual, classifique o procedimento (ex.: (A) PAD/sindicância (sinais: portaria de instauração, comissão, termo de indiciação, instrução, defesa, relatório); (B) processo administrativo geral/recursal (sinais: decisão administrativa, ciência, pedido de reconsideração, recurso, autoridade superior); (C) rito específico (se o processo mencionar norma/rito próprio); etc.). Se não houver evidência suficiente, declare “tipo não identificável” e prossiga com cautela.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;5) Diagnóstico do estágio processual: identifique o ato mais recente e determine o estágio atual do fluxo processual, escolhendo entre estados como, por exemplo:
      - aguardando ciência/intimação
      - prazo aberto para manifestação/recurso
      - pedido de reconsideração cabível/pendente
      - recurso interposto aguardando admissibilidade/encaminhamento
      - em juízo de retratação/decisão recursal
      - diligência/complementação pendente
      - decisão recursal proferida aguardando cumprimento
      - etc.
      Se houver mais de uma interpretação plausível, apresente hipóteses com critérios e evidências.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;6) Prazos (somente se determinável): se houver data de ciência/intimação e regra de prazo explícita no processo, calcule a data-limite e registre. Caso contrário, escreva “prazo não determinável com os dados fornecidos”.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;7) Seleção da peça “cabível e suficiente”: com base no estágio identificado, escolha a peça adequada (ex.: manifestação, juntada/cumprimento de diligência, pedido de reconsideração, recurso administrativo/hierárquico, pedido de prosseguimento, etc.). Explique por que essa é a peça correta para o estágio.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;8) Redação da peça final: redija o documento completo para protocolo no SEI, com:
      (a) Endereçamento: use a autoridade/unidade explicitamente indicada como competente no processo; se não existir indicação clara, use forma neutra (“À Autoridade Competente/À Unidade Responsável pelo Processo”).
      (b) Referência: Processo SEI nº &lt;!-- placeholder_sei --&gt;.
      (c) Qualificação: &lt;!-- placeholder_parte --&gt; conforme constar no processo (sem inventar dados).
      (d) Descrição do histórico com marcos relevantes.
      (e) Fundamentação: fatos e, quando aplicável, referências a atos normativos mencionados no conteúdo do próprio processo ou que compõem o ordenamento jurídico brasileiro.
      (f) Pedidos: numerados, objetivos, coerentes com o estágio (ex.: recebimento, conhecimento, encaminhamento, juntada, reabertura de prazo se cabível e fundamentada por evidência do processo, etc.).
      (g) Anexos: lista do que será juntado.
      (h) Fecho: local e data [[data_elaboracao]] e assinatura.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;9) Checklist de protocolo: liste passos práticos (assinar, conferir anexos, conferir unidade destinatária no SEI, atenção a prazos identificados).&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;10) Formato de saída: entregue exatamente em 3 blocos:
      (I) Diagnóstico do estágio + evidências + (se aplicável) hipóteses alternativas;
      (II) Linha do tempo (tabela);
      (III) Peça final + anexos + checklist.&lt;/instruction&gt;
  &lt;/instructions&gt;

  &lt;evaluation_checklist&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;O tipo de procedimento foi classificado com base em evidência (ou marcado como não identificável)?&lt;/check&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;O estágio processual foi declarado e justificado com evidências rastreáveis?&lt;/check&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;Há linha do tempo completa e consistente?&lt;/check&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;Há cálculo de prazo apenas quando determinável (sem chute)?&lt;/check&gt;

    (3) identificar o estágio atual do fluxo processual com evidências explícitas;
    (4) redigir a peça cabível e suficiente a ser apresentada pela parte denominada &lt;!-- placeholder_parte --&gt; para dar continuidade ao devido processo.
    Sucesso = diagnóstico auditável + peça pronta para protocolo + anexos/checklist, sem invenções.
  &lt;/purpose&gt;

  &lt;context&gt;
    &lt;style_guide&gt;
      &lt;language&gt;pt-BR&lt;/language&gt;
      &lt;format&gt;The response must be both thorough, comprehensive, exhaustive, complete, and in-depth in its detail, as well as wide-ranging, broad, vast, widespread, and far-reaching in its scope.&lt;/format&gt;
    &lt;/style_guide&gt;

    &lt;ethical_guardrails&gt;
      &lt;rule&gt;Não invente fatos, datas, atos, decisões, prazos, autoridades, unidades ou documentos.&lt;/rule&gt;
      &lt;rule&gt;Cite normativos/artigos/incisos específicos se eles estiverem presentes em [[conteudo_processo]], ou no ordenamento jurídico brasileiro (Constituição Federal de 1988, Emendas Constitucionais, Tratados Internacionais de Direitos Humanos, Leis Complementares, Leis Ordinárias, Leis Delegadas, Medidas Provisórias, Decretos Legislativos, Resoluções, Tratados Internacionais Comuns, Decretos Autônomos, Decretos Regulamentares, Portarias, Instruções Normativas, Convenções e Acordos Coletivos de Trabalho, Súmulas Vinculantes, Jurisprudência, Súmulas Comuns, Doutrina, Costumes, Princípios Gerais do Direito).&lt;/rule&gt;
      &lt;rule&gt;Se algo essencial estiver ausente (ex.: última decisão, data de ciência, regra de prazo), declare “não determinável com os dados fornecidos” e liste a lacuna.&lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;/ethical_guardrails&gt;

    &lt;constraints&gt;
      &lt;constraint&gt;Baseie toda a análise e a redação apenas em [[conteudo_processo]], bem como no ordenamento jurídico brasileiro (Constituição Federal de 1988, Emendas Constitucionais, Tratados Internacionais de Direitos Humanos, Leis Complementares, Leis Ordinárias, Leis Delegadas, Medidas Provisórias, Decretos Legislativos, Resoluções, Tratados Internacionais Comuns, Decretos Autônomos, Decretos Regulamentares, Portarias, Instruções Normativas, Convenções e Acordos Coletivos de Trabalho, Súmulas Vinculantes, Jurisprudência, Súmulas Comuns, Doutrina, Costumes, Princípios Gerais do Direito).&lt;/constraint&gt;
      &lt;constraint&gt;Use evidências curtas e rastreáveis (título da peça + data; se houver, identificador do documento SEI e/ou página/trecho curto; etc.).&lt;/constraint&gt;
      &lt;constraint&gt;O resultado final deve ser protocolável no SEI (texto final coeso, pedidos claros e anexos listados).&lt;/constraint&gt;
    &lt;/constraints&gt;
  &lt;/context&gt;

  &lt;instructions&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;1) Leitura: leia integralmente [[conteudo_processo]].&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;2) Extração estruturada: identifique e liste (com evidência) as peças/atos do processo (ex.: requerimentos, despachos, decisões, notificações/intimações, recursos, encaminhamentos, pareceres, etc.).&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;3) Linha do tempo: construa uma tabela com colunas: Data | Peça/Ato | Unidade/Autoridade | Efeito processual (abre prazo? decide? diligencia? encaminha?) | Evidência (referência curta).&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;4) Classificação do procedimento (obrigatória): com base em evidência textual, classifique o procedimento (ex.: (A) PAD/sindicância (sinais: portaria de instauração, comissão, termo de indiciação, instrução, defesa, relatório); (B) processo administrativo geral/recursal (sinais: decisão administrativa, ciência, pedido de reconsideração, recurso, autoridade superior); (C) rito específico (se o processo mencionar norma/rito próprio); etc.). Se não houver evidência suficiente, declare “tipo não identificável” e prossiga com cautela.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;5) Diagnóstico do estágio processual: identifique o ato mais recente e determine o estágio atual do fluxo processual, escolhendo entre estados como, por exemplo:
      - aguardando ciência/intimação
      - prazo aberto para manifestação/recurso
      - pedido de reconsideração cabível/pendente
      - recurso interposto aguardando admissibilidade/encaminhamento
      - em juízo de retratação/decisão recursal
      - diligência/complementação pendente
      - decisão recursal proferida aguardando cumprimento
      - etc.
      Se houver mais de uma interpretação plausível, apresente hipóteses com critérios e evidências.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;6) Prazos (somente se determinável): se houver data de ciência/intimação e regra de prazo explícita no processo, calcule a data-limite e registre. Caso contrário, escreva “prazo não determinável com os dados fornecidos”.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;7) Seleção da peça “cabível e suficiente”: com base no estágio identificado, escolha a peça adequada (ex.: manifestação, juntada/cumprimento de diligência, pedido de reconsideração, recurso administrativo/hierárquico, pedido de prosseguimento, etc.). Explique por que essa é a peça correta para o estágio.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;8) Redação da peça final: redija o documento completo para protocolo no SEI, com:
      (a) Endereçamento: use a autoridade/unidade explicitamente indicada como competente no processo; se não existir indicação clara, use forma neutra (“À Autoridade Competente/À Unidade Responsável pelo Processo”).
      (b) Referência: Processo SEI nº &lt;!-- placeholder_sei --&gt;.
      (c) Qualificação: &lt;!-- placeholder_parte --&gt; conforme constar no processo (sem inventar dados).
      (d) Descrição do histórico com marcos relevantes.
      (e) Fundamentação: fatos e, quando aplicável, referências a atos normativos mencionados no conteúdo do próprio processo ou que compõem o ordenamento jurídico brasileiro.
      (f) Pedidos: numerados, objetivos, coerentes com o estágio (ex.: recebimento, conhecimento, encaminhamento, juntada, reabertura de prazo se cabível e fundamentada por evidência do processo, etc.).
      (g) Anexos: lista do que será juntado.
      (h) Fecho: local e data [[data_elaboracao]] e assinatura.&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;9) Checklist de protocolo: liste passos práticos (assinar, conferir anexos, conferir unidade destinatária no SEI, atenção a prazos identificados).&lt;/instruction&gt;

    &lt;instruction&gt;10) Formato de saída: entregue exatamente em 3 blocos:
      (I) Diagnóstico do estágio + evidências + (se aplicável) hipóteses alternativas;
      (II) Linha do tempo (tabela);
      (III) Peça final + anexos + checklist.&lt;/instruction&gt;
  &lt;/instructions&gt;

  &lt;evaluation_checklist&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;O tipo de procedimento foi classificado com base em evidência (ou marcado como não identificável)?&lt;/check&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;O estágio processual foi declarado e justificado com evidências rastreáveis?&lt;/check&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;Há linha do tempo completa e consistente?&lt;/check&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;Há cálculo de prazo apenas quando determinável (sem chute)?&lt;/check&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;A peça final evita dados inventados?&lt;/check&gt;
    &lt;check&gt;Pedidos estão numerados e alinhados ao estágio?&lt;/check&gt;

They can be used in the `Find...' and `Replace...' search dialogs and are at the core of Color Syntax Highlighting patterns.  To specify a regular expression in a search dialog, simply click on the `Regular Expression' radio button in the dialog. 

A regex is a specification of a pattern to be matched in the searched text. This pattern consists of a sequence of tokens, each being able to match a single character or a sequence of characters in the text, or assert that a specific position within the text has been reached (the latter is called an anchor.)  Tokens (also called atoms) can be modified by adding one of a number of special quantifier tokens immediately after the token.  A quantifier token specifies how many times the previous token must be matched (see below.) 

Tokens can be grouped together using one of a number of grouping constructs, the most common being plain parentheses.  Tokens that are grouped in this way are also collectively considered to be a regex atom, since this new larger atom may also be modified by a quantifier. 

A regex can also be organized into a list of alternatives by separating each alternative with pipe characters, `|'.  This is called alternation.  A match will be attempted for each alternative listed, in the order specified, until a match results or the list of alternatives is exhausted (see Alternation section below.) 

The 'Any' Character

If a dot (`.') appears in a regex, it means to match any character exactly once.  By default, dot will not match a newline character, but this behavior can be changed (see help topic Parenthetical Constructs, under the heading, Matching Newlines). 

Character Classes

A character class, or range, matches exactly one character of text, but the candidates for matching are limited to those specified by the class.  Classes come in two flavors as described below: 

     [...]   Regular class, match only characters listed.
     [^...]  Negated class, match only characters not listed.

As with the dot token, by default negated character classes do not match newline, but can be made to do so. 

The characters that are considered special within a class specification are different than the rest of regex syntax as follows. If the first character in a class is the `]' character (second character if the first character is `^') it is a literal character and part of the class character set.  This also applies if the first or last character is `-'.  Outside of these rules, two characters separated by `-' form a character range which includes all the characters between the two characters as well.  For example, `[^f-j]' is the same as `[^fghij]' and means to match any character that is not `f', `g', `h', `i', or `j'. 

Anchors

Anchors are assertions that you are at a very specific position within the search text.  XNEdit regular expressions support the following anchor tokens: 

     ^    Beginning of line
     $    End of line
     &lt;    Left word boundary
     &gt;    Right word boundary
     \B   Not a word boundary

Note that the \B token ensures that neither the left nor the right character are delimiters, or that both left and right characters are delimiters. The left word anchor checks whether the previous character is a delimiter and the next character is not. The right word anchor works in a similar way. 

Note that word delimiters are user-settable, and defined by the X resource wordDelimiters, cf. X Resources. 

Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many times the previous regular expression atom may be matched in the search text.  Some quantifiers can produce a large performance penalty, and can in some instances completely lock up XNEdit.  To prevent this, avoid nested quantifiers, especially those of the maximal matching type (see below.) 

The following quantifiers are maximal matching, or "greedy", in that they match as much text as possible (but don't exclude shorter matches if that is necessary to achieve an overall match). 

     *   Match zero or more
     +   Match one  or more
     ?   Match zero or one

The following quantifiers are minimal matching, or "lazy", in that they match as little text as possible (but don't exclude longer matches if that is necessary to achieve an overall match). 

     *?   Match zero or more
     +?   Match one  or more
     ??   Match zero or one

One final quantifier is the counting quantifier, or brace quantifier. It takes the following basic form: 

     {min,max}  Match from `min' to `max' times the
                previous regular expression atom.

If `min' is omitted, it is assumed to be zero.  If `max' is omitted, it is assumed to be infinity.  Whether specified or assumed, `min' must be less than or equal to `max'.  Note that both `min' and `max' are limited to 65535.  If both are omitted, then the construct is the same as `*'.   Note that `{,}' and `{}' are both valid brace constructs.  A single number appearing without a comma, e.g. `{3}' is short for the `{min,min}' construct, or to match exactly `min' number of times. 

The quantifiers `{1}' and `{1,1}' are accepted by the syntax, but are optimized away since they mean to match exactly once, which is redundant information.  Also, for efficiency, certain combinations of `min' and `max' are converted to either `*', `+', or `?' as follows: 

     {} {,} {0,}    *
     {1,}           +
     {,1} {0,1}     ?

Note that {0} and {0,0} are meaningless and will generate an error message at regular expression compile time. 

Brace quantifiers can also be "lazy".  For example {2,5}? would try to match 2 times if possible, and will only match 3, 4, or 5 times if that is what is necessary to achieve an overall match. 

Alternation

A series of alternative patterns to match can be specified by separating them with vertical pipes, `|'.  An example of alternation would be `a|be|sea'. This will match `a', or `be', or `sea'. Each alternative can be an arbitrarily complex regular expression. The alternatives are attempted in the order specified.  An empty alternative can be specified if desired, e.g. `a|b|'.  Since an empty alternative can match nothingness (the empty string), this guarantees that the expression will match. 

Comments

Comments are of the form `(?#&lt;comment text&gt;)' and can be inserted anywhere and have no effect on the execution of the regular expression.  They can be handy for documenting very complex regular expressions.  Note that a comment begins with `(?#' and ends at the first occurrence of an ending parenthesis, or the end of the regular expression... period.  Comments do not recognize any escape sequences. 

Escaping Metacharacters

In a regular expression (regex), most ordinary characters match themselves. For example, `ab%' would match anywhere `a' followed by `b' followed by `%' appeared in the text.  Other characters don't match themselves, but are metacharacters. For example, backslash is a special metacharacter which 'escapes' or changes the meaning of the character following it. Thus, to match a literal backslash would require a regular expression to have two backslashes in sequence. XNEdit provides the following escape sequences so that metacharacters that are used by the regex syntax can be specified as ordinary characters. 

     \(  \)  \-  \[  \]  \&lt;  \&gt;  \{  \}
     \.  \|  \^  \$  \*  \+  \?  \&amp;  \\

Special Control Characters

There are some special characters that are  difficult or impossible to type. Many of these characters can be constructed as a sort of metacharacter or sequence by preceding a literal character with a backslash. XNEdit recognizes the following special character sequences: 

     \a  alert (bell)
     \b  backspace
     \e  ASCII escape character (***)
     \f  form feed (new page)
     \n  newline
     \r  carriage return
     \t  horizontal tab
     \v  vertical tab

     *** For environments that use the EBCDIC character set,
         when compiling XNEdit set the EBCDIC_CHARSET compiler
         symbol to get the EBCDIC equivalent escape
         character.)

Octal and Hex Escape Sequences

Any ASCII (or EBCDIC) character, except null, can be specified by using either an octal escape or a hexadecimal escape, each beginning with \0 or \x (or \X), respectively.  For example, \052 and \X2A both specify the `*' character.  Escapes for null (\00 or \x0) are not valid and will generate an error message.  Also, any escape that exceeds \0377 or \xFF will either cause an error or have any additional character(s) interpreted literally. For example, \0777 will be interpreted as \077 (a `?' character) followed by `7' since \0777 is greater than \0377. 

An invalid digit will also end an octal or hexadecimal escape.  For example, \091 will cause an error since `9' is not within an octal escape's range of allowable digits (0-7) and truncation before the `9' yields \0 which is invalid. 

Shortcut Escape Sequences

XNEdit defines some escape sequences that are handy shortcuts for commonly used character classes. 

   \d  digits            0-9
   \l  letters           a-z, A-Z, and locale dependent letters
   \s  whitespace        \t, \r, \v, \f, and space
   \w  word characters   letters, digits, and underscore, `_'

\D, \L, \S, and \W are the same as the lowercase versions except that the resulting character class is negated.  For example, \d is equivalent to `[0-9]', while \D is equivalent to `[^0-9]'. 

These escape sequences can also be used within a character class.  For example, `[\l_]' is the same as `[a-zA-Z_]', extended with possible locale dependent letters. The escape sequences for special characters, and octal and hexadecimal escapes are also valid within a class. 

Word Delimiter Tokens

Although not strictly a character class, the following escape sequences behave similarly to character classes: 

     \y   Word delimiter character
     \Y   Not a word delimiter character

The `\y' token matches any single character that is one of the characters that XNEdit recognizes as a word delimiter character, while the `\Y' token matches any character that is not a word delimiter character.  Word delimiter characters are dynamic in nature, meaning that the user can change them through preference settings.  For this reason, they must be handled differently by the regular expression engine.  As a consequence of this, `\y' and `\Y' cannot be used within a character class specification. 

Capturing Parentheses

Capturing Parentheses are of the form `(&lt;regex&gt;)' and can be used to group arbitrarily complex regular expressions.  Parentheses can be nested, but the total number of parentheses, nested or otherwise, is limited to 50 pairs. The text that is matched by the regular expression between a matched set of parentheses is captured and available for text substitutions and backreferences (see below.)  Capturing parentheses carry a fairly high overhead both in terms of memory used and execution speed, especially if quantified by `*' or `+'. 

Non-Capturing Parentheses

Non-Capturing Parentheses are of the form `(?:&lt;regex&gt;)' and facilitate grouping only and do not incur the overhead of normal capturing parentheses. They should not be counted when determining numbers for capturing parentheses which are used with backreferences and substitutions.  Because of the limit on the number of capturing parentheses allowed in a regex, it is advisable to use non-capturing parentheses when possible. 

Positive Look-Ahead

Positive look-ahead constructs are of the form `(?=&lt;regex&gt;)' and implement a zero width assertion of the enclosed regular expression.  In other words, a match of the regular expression contained in the positive look-ahead construct is attempted.  If it succeeds, control is passed to the next regular expression atom, but the text that was consumed by the positive look-ahead is first unmatched (backtracked) to the place in the text where the positive look-ahead was first encountered. 

One application of positive look-ahead is the manual implementation of a first character discrimination optimization.  You can include a positive look-ahead that contains a character class which lists every character that the following (potentially complex) regular expression could possibly start with.  This will quickly filter out match attempts that cannot possibly succeed. 

Negative Look-Ahead

Negative look-ahead takes the form `(?!&lt;regex&gt;)' and is exactly the same as positive look-ahead except that the enclosed regular expression must NOT match.  This can be particularly useful when you have an expression that is general, and you want to exclude some special cases.  Simply precede the general expression with a negative look-ahead that covers the special cases that need to be filtered out. 

Positive Look-Behind

Positive look-behind constructs are of the form `(?&lt;=&lt;regex&gt;)' and implement a zero width assertion of the enclosed regular expression in front of the current matching position.  It is similar to a positive look-ahead assertion, except for the fact that the match is attempted on the text preceding the current position, possibly even in front of the start of the matching range of the entire regular expression. 

A restriction on look-behind expressions is the fact that the expression must match a string of a bounded size.  In other words, `*', `+', and `{n,}' quantifiers are not allowed inside the look-behind expression. Moreover, matching performance is sensitive to the difference between the upper and lower bound on the matching size.  The smaller the difference, the better the performance.  This is especially important for regular expressions used in highlight patterns. 

Positive look-behind has similar applications as positive look-ahead. 

Negative Look-Behind

Negative look-behind takes the form `(?&lt;!&lt;regex&gt;)' and is exactly the same as positive look-behind except that the enclosed regular expression must not match. The same restrictions apply. 

Note however, that performance is even more sensitive to the distance between the size boundaries: a negative look-behind must not match for any possible size, so the matching engine must check every size. 

Case Sensitivity

There are two parenthetical constructs that control case sensitivity: 

     (?i&lt;regex&gt;)   Case insensitive; `AbcD' and `aBCd' are
                   equivalent.

     (?I&lt;regex&gt;)   Case sensitive;   `AbcD' and `aBCd' are
                   different.

Regular expressions are case sensitive by default, that is, `(?I&lt;regex&gt;)' is assumed.  All regular expression token types respond appropriately to case insensitivity including character classes and backreferences.  There is some extra overhead involved when case insensitivity is in effect, but only to the extent of converting each character compared to lower case. 

Matching Newlines

XNEdit regular expressions by default handle the matching of newlines in a way that should seem natural for most editing tasks.  There are situations, however, that require finer control over how newlines are matched by some regular expression tokens. 

By default, XNEdit regular expressions will not match a newline character for the following regex tokens: dot (`.'); a negated character class (`[^...]'); and the following shortcuts for character classes: 

     `\d', `\D', `\l', `\L', `\s', `\S', `\w', `\W', `\Y'

The matching of newlines can be controlled for the `.' token, negated character classes, and the `\s' and `\S' shortcuts by using one of the following parenthetical constructs: 

     (?n&lt;regex&gt;)  `.', `[^...]', `\s', `\S' match newlines

     (?N&lt;regex&gt;)  `.', `[^...]', `\s', `\S' don't match
                                            newlines

`(?N&lt;regex&gt;)' is the default behavior. 

Notes on New Parenthetical Constructs

Except for plain parentheses, none of the parenthetical constructs capture text.  If that is desired, the construct must be wrapped with capturing parentheses, e.g. `((?i&lt;regex))'. 

All parenthetical constructs can be nested as deeply as desired, except for capturing parentheses which have a limit of 50 sets of parentheses, regardless of nesting level. 

Back References

Backreferences allow you to match text captured by a set of capturing parenthesis at some later position in your regular expression.  A backreference is specified using a single backslash followed by a single digit from 1 to 9 (example: \3).  Backreferences have similar syntax to substitutions (see below), but are different from substitutions in that they appear within the regular expression, not the substitution string. The number specified with a backreference identifies which set of text capturing parentheses the backreference is associated with. The text that was most recently captured by these parentheses is used by the backreference to attempt a match.  As with substitutions, open parentheses are counted from left to right beginning with 1.  So the backreference `\3' will try to match another occurrence of the text most recently matched by the third set of capturing parentheses.  As an example, the regular expression `(\d)\1' could match `22', `33', or `00', but wouldn't match `19' or `01'. 

A backreference must be associated with a parenthetical expression that is complete.  The expression `(\w(\1))' contains an invalid backreference since the first set of parentheses are not complete at the point where the backreference appears. 

Substitution

Substitution strings are used to replace text matched by a set of capturing parentheses.  The substitution string is mostly interpreted as ordinary text except as follows. 

The escape sequences described above for special characters, and octal and hexadecimal escapes are treated the same way by a substitution string. When the substitution string contains the `&amp;' character, XNEdit will substitute the entire string that was matched by the `Find...' operation. Any of the first nine sub-expressions of the match string can also be inserted into the replacement string.  This is done by inserting a `\' followed by a digit from 1 to 9 that represents the string matched by a parenthesized expression within the regular expression.  These expressions are numbered left-to-right in order of their opening parentheses. 

The capitalization of text inserted by `&amp;' or `\1', `\2', ... `\9' can be altered by preceding them with `\U', `\u', `\L', or `\l'.  `\u' and `\l' change only the first character of the inserted entity, while `\U' and `\L' change the entire entity to upper or lower case, respectively. 

Substitutions

Regular expression substitution can be used to program automatic editing operations.  For example, the following are search and replace strings to find occurrences of the `C' language subroutine `get_x', reverse the first and second parameters, add a third parameter of NULL, and change the name to `new_get_x': 

     Search string:   `get_x *\( *([^ ,]*), *([^\)]*)\)'
     Replace string:  `new_get_x(\2, \1, NULL)'

Ambiguity

If a regular expression could match two different parts of the text, it will match the one which begins earliest.  If both begin in the same place but match different lengths, or match the same length in different ways, life gets messier, as follows. 

In general, the possibilities in a list of alternatives are considered in left-to-right order.  The possibilities for `*', `+', and `?' are considered longest-first, nested constructs are considered from the outermost in, and concatenated constructs are considered leftmost-first. The match that will be chosen is the one that uses the earliest possibility in the first choice that has to be made.  If there is more than one choice, the next will be made in the same manner (earliest possibility) subject to the decision on the first choice.  And so forth. 

For example, `(ab|a)b*c' could match `abc' in one of two ways.  The first choice is between `ab' and `a'; since `ab' is earlier, and does lead to a successful overall match, it is chosen.  Since the `b' is already spoken for, the `b*' must match its last possibility, the empty string, since it must respect the earlier choice. 

In the particular case where no `|'s are present and there is only one `*', `+', or `?', the net effect is that the longest possible match will be chosen.  So `ab*', presented with `xabbbby', will match `abbbb'.  Note that if `ab*' is tried against `xabyabbbz', it will match `ab' just after `x', due to the begins-earliest rule.  (In effect, the decision on where to start the match is the first choice to be made, hence subsequent choices must respect it even if this leads them to less-preferred alternatives.)

The first end second editions of this book are still useful for basic introduction to regexes and contain many useful tips and tricks. 

The following are regular expression examples which will match: 

    * An entire line.
        ^.*$

    * Blank lines.
        ^$

    * Whitespace on a line.
        \s+

    * Whitespace across lines.
        (?n\s+)

    * Whitespace that spans at least two lines. Note minimal matching `*?' quantifier.
        (?n\s*?\n\s*)

    * IP address (not robust).
        (?:\d{1,3}(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})

    * Two character US Postal state abbreviations (includes territories).
        [ACDF-IK-PR-W][A-Z]

    * Web addresses.
        (?:http://)?www\.\S+

    * Case insensitive double words across line breaks.
        (?i(?n&lt;(\S+)\s+\1&gt;))

    * Upper case words with possible punctuation.
        &lt;[A-Z][^a-z\s]*&gt;
