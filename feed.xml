# Script to install fclones and use it to remove duplicate files from a specified directory.
# This script will:
# 1. Ensure necessary build tools (including for xattr) and Rust/Cargo are installed.
# 2. Install fclones using &#39;cargo install&#39;.
# 3. Add ~/.cargo/bin to the PATH for the current session and .bashrc for future sessions.
# 4. Set up Bash completions for fclones.
# 5. Run fclones to group and remove duplicate files from the target directory,
#    keeping only unique files and the first encountered copy of duplicates, after user confirmation.
#
# Target Environment: Debian 11 (Bullseye) on ARM64 RK3588
# Tutorial Name: Leveraging `fclones` to remove each and every duplicated file, so, keeping only the uniques and the first copy of the duplicates, from the location named `/home/linaro/Downloads` recursively, with depth 10, on my debian bullseye arm64 rk3588 machine.

# --- Configuration Variables ---
# The tutorial specifies /home/linaro/Downloads.
# This script uses /home/linaro/Downloads for better portability if the username is not &#39;linaro&#39;,
# assuming the script is run by the intended user.
# If you strictly need /home/linaro/Downloads and your username is different, adjust this.

We’ll use your network interface `enP2p33s0` (currently `192.168.15.3/24`) and your router’s gateway (`192.168.15.1`) as the basis for examples.</p>

<p>Below is a step-by-step tutorial to change your Debian Bullseye machine’s IP address.</p>

<h2 id="1-confirm-current-settings--choose-your-static-ip"><strong>1. Confirm Current Settings &amp; Choose Your Static IP</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Current Interface and IP:</strong> Your primary network interface is enP2p33s0, currently using 192.168.15.3/24.</li>
  <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> Your router’s IP address is 192.168.15.1.</li>
  <li><strong>DNS Servers (Current):</strong> Your system logs show you’re using 8.8.8.8 and 127.0.0.53. The 127.0.0.53 address means systemd-resolved is active and acting as a local DNS stub resolver. /etc/resolv.conf will point to it, but systemd-resolved forwards queries to upstream DNS servers configured elsewhere (or via DHCP). For a static configuration, you’ll explicitly set these upstream servers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Choose Your Static IP:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>It must be in the 192.168.15.x range.</li>
  <li>It must <strong>not</strong> be 192.168.15.1 (your router).</li>
  <li>It must <strong>not</strong> be used by another device on your network.</li>
  <li><strong>Crucially:</strong> It should be <strong>outside your router’s DHCP assignment range</strong>. Log into your ASKEY RTF8115VW router to check its DHCP settings (usually under LAN or DHCP Server sections) and find the range of IPs it assigns automatically (e.g., 192.168.15.100 to 192.168.15.200). Choose an IP outside this range, for example, 192.168.15.50.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Static IP Details for this Tutorial (Example):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> 192.168.15.50</li>
  <li><strong>Netmask:</strong> 255.255.255.0 (which is /24 in CIDR notation)</li>
  <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> 192.168.15.1</li>
  <li><strong>DNS Servers (Example Choices):</strong> 8.8.8.8 (Google) and 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare). Alternatively, you could use your router’s IP as a DNS forwarder, e.g., 192.168.15.1 and 8.8.8.8. <em>Use the DNS servers you prefer.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-back-up-the-current-network-configuration"><strong>2. Back Up the Current Network Configuration</strong></h2>

<p>Before making any changes, always back up your configuration. If your system uses ifupdown (common on Debian server installations), the main file is /etc/network/interfaces.</p>

<p>sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.backup_$(date +%F)</p>

<p>If you plan to edit systemd-networkd files or NetworkManager configurations, back up relevant files from /etc/systemd/network/ or /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ respectively, if they exist and are being modified.</p>

<h2 id="3-determine-your-network-management-system"><strong>3. Determine Your Network Management System</strong></h2>

<p>Debian can use different systems to manage network configurations. You need to identify which one is actively managing enP2p33s0:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ifupdown (via /etc/network/interfaces):<br />
Check the contents: cat /etc/network/interfaces.<br />
If you see a stanza for enP2p33s0 like auto enP2p33s0 and iface enP2p33s0 inet dhcp, ifupdown is likely managing this interface. This is a traditional method, often default on servers.</li>
  <li>systemd-networkd:<br />
Check its status: sudo systemctl is-active systemd-networkd.<br />
If active, check for configuration files in /etc/systemd/network/ (e.g., ls /etc/systemd/network/). A .network file matching your interface might exist.</li>
  <li>NetworkManager:<br />
Check its status: sudo systemctl is-active NetworkManager.<br />
If active (common on desktop environments), confirm it’s managing the interface: nmcli dev status. Look for enP2p33s0.</li>
</ul>

<p>This tutorial will primarily cover <strong>Method A (ifupdown)</strong> and <strong>Method B (systemd-networkd)</strong>, with an overview of Method C (NetworkManager). Choose the method appropriate for your system.</p>

<h2 id="4-method-a--using-etcnetworkinterfaces-ifupdown"><strong>4. Method A – Using /etc/network/interfaces (ifupdown)</strong></h2>

<p>This is the traditional Debian method.</p>

<p><strong>a. Edit the configuration file:</strong></p>

<p>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces</p>

<p>b. Modify the stanza for enP2p33s0:<br />
Find the lines for enP2p33s0. If it’s set for DHCP, it might look like:<br />
auto enP2p33s0<br />
iface enP2p33s0 inet dhcp</p>

<p>Comment out or delete these lines and add/modify the stanza for a static configuration. If no entry exists, add the following:</p>

<p># The primary network interface<br />
auto enP2p33s0<br />
iface enP2p33s0 inet static<br />
    address 192.168.15.50        # Your chosen static IP<br />
    netmask 255.255.255.0        # Your netmask<br />
    gateway 192.168.15.1         # Your gateway IP<br />
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1 # Your chosen DNS servers (space separated)<br />
    # dns-search yourlocaldomain.example # Optional: for local domain search</p>

<p>c. Save and Exit:<br />
In nano, press Ctrl+O (Write Out), then Enter, then Ctrl+X (Exit).<br />
d. Apply the Changes:<br />
Restart the networking service:<br />
sudo systemctl restart networking.service</p>

<p>Or, bring the interface down and then up (may cause a brief disconnection):</p>

<p>sudo ifdown enP2p33s0 &amp;&amp; sudo ifup enP2p33s0</p>

<p><em>(If ifdown complains or the settings don’t apply, another service like NetworkManager might be interfering. If NetworkManager is active and you intend to use ifupdown for this interface, you may need to stop/disable NetworkManager (sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager; sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager) or configure NetworkManager to ignore enP2p33s0 e.g., by adding unmanaged-devices=interface-name:enP2p33s0 to /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and restarting NetworkManager).</em></p>

<h2 id="5-method-b--using-systemd-networkd"><strong>5. Method B – Using systemd-networkd</strong></h2>

<p>If systemd-networkd is managing your network:</p>

<p>a. Create a configuration file:<br />
File names in /etc/systemd/network/ are typically prefixed with a number (e.g., 10- or 20- for ordering) and end in .network.<br />
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/20-wired-static-enP2p33s0.network</p>

<p><strong>b. Add the following configuration:</strong></p>

<p>[Match]<br />
Name=enP2p33s0</p>

<p>[Network]<br />
Address=192.168.15.50/24   # Your static IP with CIDR netmask<br />
Gateway=192.168.15.1      # Your gateway<br />
DNS=8.8.8.8               # Primary DNS (use your chosen server)<br />
DNS=1.1.1.1               # Secondary DNS (use your chosen server)<br />
# You can add more DNS= lines if needed<br />
# Or use your router as a DNS: DNS=192.168.15.1</p>

<p><strong>c. Save and Exit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>d. Set permissions and restart the service:</strong></p>

<p>sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/network/20-wired-static-enP2p33s0.network<br />
sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd # Ensure it’s enabled to start on boot<br />
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd</p>

<p>systemd-resolved (which is active on your system) should pick up these DNS settings from systemd-networkd.</p>

<h2 id="6-method-c--using-networkmanager-brief-overview"><strong>6. Method C – Using NetworkManager (Brief Overview)</strong></h2>

<p>If your system (especially a desktop) uses NetworkManager:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Graphical Tool:</strong> Use your desktop environment’s network settings GUI. Find your wired connection (enP2p33s0), change its IPv4 settings from “Automatic (DHCP)” to “Manual,” and enter your desired IP address, netmask, gateway, and DNS servers. Save and apply.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Text User Interface (</strong>nmtui<strong>):</strong><br />
sudo nmtui</p>

    <p>Navigate to “Edit a connection,” select enP2p33s0 (or its connection name), choose “Edit…”, change “IPv4 CONFIGURATION” to “Manual,” and fill in the Addresses, Gateway, and DNS servers fields. Select “OK” and quit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Command Line (</strong>nmcli<strong>):</strong> This is more advanced. First, find your connection name: nmcli con show. Let’s assume it’s “Wired connection 1”.<br />
sudo nmcli con mod “Wired connection 1” ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.15.50/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.15.1 ipv4.dns “8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1”<br />
sudo nmcli con down “Wired connection 1” &amp;&amp; sudo nmcli con up “Wired connection 1”</p>

    <p><em>(Note: For ipv4.dns, provide a space-separated list of DNS servers within the quotes).</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-test-connectivity"><strong>7. Test Connectivity</strong></h2>

<p>After applying changes using your chosen method, verify the configuration:</p>

<p><strong>a. Check IP Address:</strong></p>

<p>ip -br addr show enP2p33s0</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>ip addr show enP2p33s0</p>

<p>You should see inet 192.168.15.50/24 (or your chosen static IP) associated with enP2p33s0.</p>

<p><strong>b. Check Routing Table:</strong></p>

<p>ip route show</p>

<p>Ensure the default route is via your gateway (e.g., default via 192.168.15.1 dev enP2p33s0).</p>

<p>c. Check DNS Resolution:<br />
Your /etc/resolv.conf file will likely show nameserver 127.0.0.53. This is expected when systemd-resolved is active. systemd-resolved listens on this local address and forwards DNS queries to the upstream servers you configured. To see the actual upstream DNS servers being used by systemd-resolved:<br />
resolvectl status</p>

<p>or</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>systemd-resolve --status</td>
      <td>grep -A3 ‘Current DNS Server’</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This should show the DNS servers you configured (e.g., 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1).</p>

<p><strong>d. Ping Tests:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ping your gateway:<br />
ping -c 3 192.168.15.1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ping an external IP address (tests IP connectivity beyond your LAN):<br />
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ping a domain name (tests DNS resolution and full internet connectivity):<br />
ping -c 3 google.com</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If all these tests pass, your static IP configuration is working correctly.</p>

<h2 id="8-important-considerations--reverting"><strong>8. Important Considerations &amp; Reverting</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SSH Disconnection:</strong> If you are connected to your Debian machine via SSH, changing its IP address will disconnect your session. Ensure you have physical console access or an alternative way to access the machine if issues arise.</li>
  <li><strong>IP Conflicts:</strong> Double-check that the static IP you chose is unique on your network and is <strong>not</strong> within your router’s DHCP assignment range to prevent IP address conflicts.</li>
  <li><strong>Router’s DHCP Reservation (Alternative):</strong> Instead of setting a static IP directly on the Debian machine, you can configure your ASKEY RTF8115VW router to always assign the same IP address to your Debian machine’s MAC address. This is often called “DHCP Reservation” or “Static DHCP Lease.”
    <ul>
      <li>To use this method: Find your enP2p33s0 MAC address (ip link show enP2p33s0). Log into your router, find the DHCP reservation settings, and map the MAC address to your desired IP (e.g., 192.168.15.50).</li>
      <li><strong>Crucially:</strong> If you use DHCP reservation on your router, ensure your Debian machine’s network interface (enP2p33s0) is configured to obtain an IP address <strong>automatically via DHCP</strong> (i.e., revert any static IP settings on the Debian machine itself).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reverting to DHCP:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Method A (/etc/network/interfaces):<br />
Restore your backup:<br />
sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces.backup_YYYY-MM-DD /etc/network/interfaces # Use your actual backup filename</p>

        <p>Then, change the enP2p33s0 stanza back to:<br />
auto enP2p33s0<br />
iface enP2p33s0 inet dhcp</p>

        <p>Save, and restart networking: sudo systemctl restart networking.service.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Method B (systemd-networkd):<br />
Remove or rename your static .network file (e.g., sudo mv /etc/systemd/network/20-wired-static-enP2p33s0.network /etc/systemd/network/20-wired-static-enP2p33s0.network.disabled).<br />
If no other .network file configures enP2p33s0 for DHCP, create one, e.g., /etc/systemd/network/10-dhcp-enP2p33s0.network:<br />
[Match]<br />
Name=enP2p33s0</p>

        <p>[Network]<br />
DHCP=yes</p>

        <p>Save, and restart: sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Method C (NetworkManager):<br />
Using nmtui or your GUI, change the IPv4 method for the connection back to “Automatic (DHCP)”.<br />
Using nmcli (replace “Wired connection 1” with your actual connection name):<br />
sudo nmcli con mod “Wired connection 1” ipv4.method auto ipv4.addresses “” ipv4.gateway “” ipv4.dns “”<br />
sudo nmcli con up “Wired connection 1”</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

Introduction: Addressing Root Partition Space on rk3588</strong></h2>

<h3 id="overview-of-the-low-space-issue"><strong>Overview of the Low Space Issue</strong></h3>

<p>This guide addresses the common and critical issue of low disk space on the root partition (/dev/root) of rk3588-based arm64 machines running Debian Bullseye. A reported usage of 81% on /dev/root signifies an impending problem that can lead to various system malfunctions. These include, but are not limited to, system instability, an inability to install essential updates or new software packages, significant performance degradation, and the potential failure of critical system services. Prompt and methodical action is required to mitigate these risks.</p>

<h3 id="importance-of-a-methodical-approach-for-rk3588-systems"><strong>Importance of a Methodical Approach for rk3588 Systems</strong></h3>

<p>The rk3588, an advanced ARM System-on-Chip (SoC), is frequently utilized in embedded devices and single-board computers. These systems typically employ eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard) for primary storage and utilize boot mechanisms such as U-Boot, along with MASKROM or Loader mode for OS flashing via USB OTG. These characteristics differentiate them significantly from standard x86-based personal computers. Direct manipulation of eMMC partitions, particularly the root partition, is inherently more complex and carries substantial risks if not executed with precision and an understanding of the platform’s specifics. Such operations often necessitate specialized tools and procedures unique to Rockchip SoCs.1 Attempting to apply standard desktop partitioning tools directly to a live eMMC root partition can lead to an unbootable system.</p>

<h3 id="guide-structure"><strong>Guide Structure</strong></h3>

<p>This document outlines a phased strategy to reclaim disk space on the /dev/root partition. The approach begins with low-risk, software-based cleanup methods that often yield significant results. It then progresses to more involved techniques, such as identifying and relocating large directories. Finally, it details the high-risk, last-resort option of resizing the root partition through a complete firmware re-flashing process. Each phase will build upon the previous, emphasizing data safety and system integrity throughout.</p>

<h2 id="2-phase-1-initial-system-assessment-and-essential-precautions"><strong>2. Phase 1: Initial System Assessment and Essential Precautions</strong></h2>

<p>Before attempting any modifications, a thorough assessment of the current system state and implementation of robust backup strategies are paramount. These preliminary steps are crucial for ensuring data integrity and providing a recovery path should any subsequent procedures encounter issues.</p>

<h3 id="verifying-current-disk-usage"><strong>Verifying Current Disk Usage</strong></h3>

<p>To accurately diagnose the low space condition, it is essential to verify the current disk usage. The following commands provide detailed information about the storage layout and utilization:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>df -Th</strong>: This command lists all mounted filesystems, their types (e.g., ext4, btrfs), total size, used space, available space, usage percentage, and mount points. Particular attention should be paid to the entry corresponding to /dev/root or the specific eMMC partition mounted as the root filesystem.</li>
  <li><strong>lsblk</strong>: This utility displays block devices (such as eMMC, SD cards, USB drives) in a hierarchical tree format. It helps in identifying the eMMC device, typically named /dev/mmcblkX (where X is a number, e.g., /dev/mmcblk0 or /dev/mmcblk2 2), and its partition structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Interpreting the output from these commands will confirm which partition is serving as /dev/root and its current level of capacity utilization.</p>

<h3 id="critical-data-backup-strategies-for-rk3588"><strong>Critical: Data Backup Strategies for rk3588</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A full and verified backup is an absolute prerequisite before proceeding with any operations beyond basic package cleaning (Phase 3), especially when considering directory relocation (Phase 4) or partition resizing (Phase 5).</strong></p>

<p>Backing up eMMC storage on an rk3588 system can present challenges compared to traditional desktop systems. Full, image-level backups often require booting into a separate recovery environment or using platform-specific tools.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Backup Methods:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User Data Backup:</strong> At a minimum, all critical user data, typically located in /home, and any custom application data stored in other directories, must be backed up to external storage. This could be a USB drive, a network-attached storage (NAS) device, or a cloud storage solution.</li>
  <li><strong>System Configuration:</strong> Key system configuration files, primarily located under /etc, should also be backed up. This includes configurations for networking, installed services, and user accounts.</li>
  <li><strong>eMMC Image Backup (Advanced):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Using dd from a Live Environment:</strong> If the rk3588 board supports booting from an alternative medium (e.g., an SD card) and that live environment can access the eMMC with appropriate drivers, the dd utility can be used to create a raw image of the eMMC partitions. This method is complex and requires a compatible live system.</li>
      <li><strong>Using rkdeveloptool:</strong> The Rockchip development tool, rkdeveloptool, provides functionality to read individual partitions from the eMMC when the device is in MASKROM or Loader mode.3 The command rkdeveloptool read-partition &lt;partition_name&gt; &lt;output_filename.img&gt; can be used to back up partitions such as uboot, trust, boot, rootfs, and userdata.4 This requires connecting the device to a host PC via USB OTG and booting it into the appropriate low-level mode. Having these raw partition images is invaluable for recovery, especially if partition table modifications are planned.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="understanding-maskromotg-flashing-implications"><strong>Understanding MASKROM/OTG Flashing Implications</strong></h3>

<p>MASKROM mode is a built-in, low-level recovery mechanism in Rockchip SoCs, including the rk3588. It allows the device to communicate with a host PC via a USB OTG connection for firmware flashing, even if the primary bootloader or operating system is corrupted.1 This mode is the ultimate recovery pathway if the system becomes unbootable due_to_errors during advanced space reclamation procedures.</p>

<p>Familiarity with the procedure to enter MASKROM or Loader mode on the specific rk3588 device (often involving pressing and holding a ‘RECOVERY’ or ‘MASKROM’ button during power-on or reset while connected via USB OTG 1) is a critical safety net. If operations in Phases 4 or 5 lead to a non-booting system, MASKROM mode provides the means to re-flash the original firmware or a known-good backup, thereby recovering the device. This understanding is directly relevant to the system’s design, which includes OS flashing via OTG/MASKROM. This precaution ensures that even if severe issues arise, a path to restoration is available, aligning with best practices for embedded system administration.</p>

<h2 id="3-phase-2-standard-system-cleanup-low-risk-high-impact"><strong>3. Phase 2: Standard System Cleanup (Low-Risk, High-Impact)</strong></h2>

<p>This phase focuses on standard Debian system maintenance tasks that are generally safe and can often free up a considerable amount of disk space. These should be the first actions taken to alleviate pressure on the root partition.</p>

<h3 id="leveraging-apt-for-package-management"><strong>Leveraging apt for Package Management</strong></h3>

<p>The Advanced Package Tool (APT) is Debian’s primary package management system. Over time, its cache and automatically installed dependencies can consume significant disk space.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>sudo apt update</strong>: Before any cleaning operations, it is essential to update the local package index to ensure APT has the latest information about available packages and their dependencies.</li>
  <li><strong>sudo apt clean</strong>: This command removes downloaded Debian package files (.deb) from the APT cache, typically located in /var/cache/apt/archives/.6 These files are retained after package installation and can accumulate, occupying valuable space. This operation is very safe and does not remove any installed packages or their configurations.</li>
  <li><strong>sudo apt autoremove --purge</strong>: This command is crucial for removing packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages but are no longer required by any installed software.6 The --purge option ensures that not only are these orphaned packages removed, but their system-wide configuration files are also deleted, further freeing up space.8 This is a standard maintenance task that helps keep the system lean.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="managing-linux-kernels"><strong>Managing Linux Kernels</strong></h3>

<p>Debian systems, by default, retain multiple Linux kernel versions. This allows users to boot into an older, known-good kernel if a newer version introduces instability or hardware compatibility issues. However, each kernel image, its corresponding headers, and associated modules consume substantial space, primarily in /boot (which is part of the root partition in many embedded setups) and /lib/modules/.6</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Identifying Current and Installed Kernels:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>uname -r: Displays the version of the currently running kernel.8 <strong>It is imperative that this kernel is NOT removed.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>dpkg -l “linux-image*” “linux-headers*” or dpkg --list</td>
              <td>grep linux-image: These commands list all installed kernel image and header packages, showing their status and version.6</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>ls /boot/: Lists the contents of the /boot directory, which includes kernel image files (typically named vmlinuz-&lt;version&gt;) and initial RAM filesystem images (initrd.img-&lt;version&gt;).8</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Safely Purging Old Kernels:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>While sudo apt autoremove is designed to remove old, unneeded kernels, its behavior can sometimes be inconsistent, occasionally leaving more kernels than necessary or failing to remove any.6 Therefore, manual verification and potential purging are recommended.</li>
      <li><strong>Manual Purge Command:</strong> To remove a specific old kernel and its headers, use: sudo apt purge &lt;kernel_image_package_name&gt; &lt;kernel_headers_package_name&gt; For example: sudo apt purge linux-image-5.10.0-X-arm64 linux-headers-5.10.0-X-arm64.</li>
      <li><strong>Caution:</strong> It is strongly advised to retain the currently running kernel and at least one other known-good previous kernel version as a fallback.6 Removing all but the current kernel can leave the system unbootable if the active kernel encounters an issue.</li>
      <li>The directories under /usr/lib/modules/ corresponding to old and unused kernel versions can also be manually removed if apt purge does not handle them, but this should be done with extreme caution and only after the corresponding kernel packages are purged.7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The variability in apt autoremove’s effectiveness for kernel cleanup underscores the need for manual checks. Relying solely on autoremove might not reclaim all possible space from old kernels. A manual review of installed kernels, followed by a careful purge of unneeded older versions (while preserving the running and a backup kernel), is a more reliable strategy for maximizing space recovery from this source.</p>

<h3 id="controlling-systemd-journal-logs"><strong>Controlling Systemd Journal Logs</strong></h3>

<p>The systemd-journald service collects and manages system logs. These logs, stored by default in /var/log/journal/ (if persistent storage is enabled) or /run/log/journal/ (for volatile storage), can grow significantly over time, especially on active systems or those with verbose logging configurations.10</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Assessing Journal Disk Usage:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>sudo journalctl --disk-usage: This command reports the total disk space currently occupied by archived and active journal files.10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Vacuuming Journal Files (Immediate Cleanup):</strong> journalctl provides options to manually reduce the size of the journal by removing older entries. These operations are non-destructive to currently active log files but will remove archived data.
    <ul>
      <li>sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=XM: Reduces the total size of journal files to a specified limit, e.g., 200M for 200 Megabytes or 1G for 1 Gigabyte.10</li>
      <li>sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=Xd: Deletes archived journal entries older than the specified time period, e.g., 7d for 7 days, 2weeks for two weeks.10</li>
      <li>sudo journalctl --vacuum-files=N: Retains only the N most recent journal files, deleting older ones.10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Persistent Journal Configuration (Long-Term Management):</strong> To prevent excessive log growth in the future, systemd-journald can be configured by editing its configuration file, /etc/systemd/journald.conf. Key parameters for controlling disk usage include 10:
    <ul>
      <li>SystemMaxUse=XM: Sets an absolute maximum disk space that persistent journal files can occupy.</li>
      <li>SystemKeepFree=YM: Ensures that at least YM of disk space is kept free on the filesystem where the journal is stored.</li>
      <li>SystemMaxFileSize=ZM: Limits the maximum size of individual journal files before they are rotated.</li>
      <li>RuntimeMaxUse=, RuntimeKeepFree=, RuntimeMaxFileSize=: Similar options for volatile journals stored in /run/log/journal.</li>
      <li>Compress=yes: Enables compression for older journal entries, saving space at the cost of some CPU overhead during compression/decompression. After modifying /etc/systemd/journald.conf, the systemd-journald service must be restarted to apply the changes: sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following table summarizes common journalctl vacuuming options for quick reference:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="general-system-file-cleanup"><strong>General System File Cleanup</strong></h3>

<p>Beyond package management and system logs, other areas can accumulate unnecessary files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>/tmp and /var/tmp: These directories are intended for temporary files. While /tmp is often configured as a tmpfs (RAM-based filesystem) and cleared on reboot, /var/tmp typically persists. Old files in /var/tmp can be manually removed.</li>
  <li>Old Application Logs in /var/log/: Besides the systemd journal, applications may write their own logs to /var/log/. Check for excessively large files (e.g., *.log.1, *.gz). Ensure logrotate is properly configured for these applications to manage log file sizes and rotation.</li>
  <li>User-specific caches: Directories like ~/.cache within user home directories can accumulate large amounts of cached data from applications. While not directly on /dev/root if /home is separate, if /home is part of /dev/root, these should be investigated.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-phase-3-identifying-and-analyzing-large-space-consumers"><strong>4. Phase 3: Identifying and Analyzing Large Space Consumers</strong></h2>

<p>After performing standard system cleanup, if the root partition space is still critically low, the next step is to identify precisely which directories and files are consuming the most space. This targeted analysis will guide further reclamation efforts.</p>

<h3 id="using-ncdu-for-interactive-disk-usage-analysis"><strong>Using ncdu for Interactive Disk Usage Analysis</strong></h3>

<p>ncdu (Ncurses Disk Usage) is a powerful and user-friendly disk usage analyzer that provides an interactive way to navigate the filesystem and identify space hogs.12</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Installation:</strong> ncdu is available in Debian Bullseye repositories and can be installed using: sudo apt install ncdu The package is available for the arm64 architecture.13</li>
  <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The recommended command to analyze the root filesystem is: sudo ncdu -x / The -x option is crucial as it confines the scan to the filesystem of the specified directory (in this case, /), preventing ncdu from traversing into other mounted filesystems (e.g., separate /home, /data, or network mounts).12 This ensures the analysis focuses solely on the root partition’s contents.</li>
      <li>Upon completion of the scan (which may take some time depending on the size and number of files), ncdu presents a sorted list of files and directories by size.</li>
      <li><strong>Navigation and Interaction</strong> 12<strong>:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the <strong>arrow keys</strong> (up/down) to navigate the list.</li>
          <li>Press <strong>Enter</strong> or the <strong>right arrow key</strong> to enter a selected directory and view its contents.</li>
          <li>Press the <strong>left arrow key</strong>, h, or &lt; to go up to the parent directory.</li>
          <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Press s to sort by size (default), n by name, C by item count, and M (capital M) by modification time. Pressing the sort key again toggles ascending/descending order.</li>
          <li><strong>Deleting:</strong> Press d to delete a selected file or directory (use with extreme caution, especially when running as root). ncdu will ask for confirmation.</li>
          <li><strong>Information:</strong> Press i to show detailed information about the selected item.</li>
          <li><strong>Help:</strong> Press ? to display the built-in help screen.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ncdu allows for a quick and effective drill-down into the directory structure to pinpoint the largest consumers of disk space, which might not be obvious from standard du output alone.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-analysis-with-du-and-find"><strong>Alternative Analysis with du and find</strong></h3>

<p>For users who prefer command-line tools for non-interactive analysis or for use in scripts, du (disk usage) and find are standard utilities that can provide similar information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>To display the total size of top-level directories within the root filesystem, sorted by size in human-readable format: sudo du -sh /*</td>
          <td>sort -rh</td>
          <td>head -n 20 This command lists the top 20 largest directories directly under /. The depth can be adjusted (e.g., sudo du -sh /var/*) to inspect specific subdirectories.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>To find individual files larger than a certain size (e.g., 1GB) anywhere on the root filesystem: sudo find / -xdev -type f -size +1G -print0</td>
          <td>xargs -0 du -h The -xdev option ensures find does not descend into directories on other filesystems, similar to ncdu -x. The size (+1G) can be adjusted (e.g., +500M for 500 Megabytes).</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While ncdu offers a more convenient interactive experience, proficiency with du and find remains a valuable skill for system administrators, providing flexibility for various diagnostic scenarios. These tools can help identify large log files, forgotten backups, or unexpectedly large application data directories that were not addressed by the standard cleanup in Phase 2.</p>

<h2 id="5-phase-4-advanced-space-reclamation---relocating-directories-medium-to-high-risk"><strong>5. Phase 4: Advanced Space Reclamation - Relocating Directories (Medium to High-Risk)</strong></h2>

<p>If significant space is still required after general cleanup and analysis, relocating large directories from the root partition to another storage location (e.g., a separate userdata partition if available and sufficiently spacious, or an external USB drive) can be an effective strategy. However, this phase involves higher risks and requires careful execution.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer-risks-and-considerations"><strong>Disclaimer: Risks and Considerations</strong></h3>

<p>Moving system directories, particularly those under /var or /usr, is a non-trivial operation that can lead to an unbootable system if not performed correctly.14 Several factors contribute to this risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>System Stability:</strong> Critical system services and the boot process itself depend on specific directory structures and file locations. Incorrectly moving these can break dependencies.</li>
  <li><strong>Boot Process Dependencies:</strong> Some directories are accessed very early in the boot sequence, potentially before all filesystems (including the target partition for relocation) are mounted. Relocating such directories requires ensuring they are available when needed, often through methods like bind mounts configured in /etc/fstab.</li>
  <li><strong>Permissions and Ownership:</strong> File and directory permissions, ownership, and extended attributes (like SELinux contexts or AppArmor profiles, if enabled) must be meticulously preserved during the copy process. Tools like rsync -aX or cp -aR are generally suitable for this.14</li>
  <li><strong>OTG/MASKROM Awareness:</strong> Given the rk3588 platform, if a directory relocation attempt fails and renders the system unbootable, recovery will likely involve using MASKROM/Loader mode to re-flash the firmware, as discussed in Phase 1. Users must be prepared for this eventuality.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="identifying-suitable-directories-for-relocation"><strong>Identifying Suitable Directories for Relocation</strong></h3>

<p>Based on the analysis from Phase 3 (ncdu or du/find), identify large directories that are candidates for relocation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Good candidates often include:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>/var/cache/apt/archives/: Can become very large if not regularly cleaned by apt clean. Relocating this directory or configuring APT to use a different cache location is a common practice.14</li>
      <li>/var/log/: If systemd journald configuration is insufficient to control its size, or if other applications generate voluminous logs in this directory.18</li>
      <li>/opt/: Frequently used for installing third-party software packages that are not part of the core OS. These can sometimes be quite large and are often safe to move, provided the applications within are not critical for the early boot process.20</li>
      <li>/srv/: If the system is used to serve large amounts of data (e.g., web server content, FTP files), this directory might be a candidate.</li>
      <li>/usr/local/: Often contains manually compiled software or locally installed packages, which can accumulate.</li>
      <li>While /home is usually on a separate partition in server setups, if it resides on the root partition and is large, its relocation methods 16 are directly applicable to other directories.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Poor candidates (generally avoid moving from the root partition):</strong> Core system directories like /bin, /sbin, /lib, /etc, /dev, /proc, /sys, and /run. The /boot directory should also not be moved from the root partition unless it’s being migrated to a dedicated boot partition, which is a more complex scenario not covered here for an already installed system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="prerequisites-for-relocation"><strong>Prerequisites for Relocation</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Target Location:</strong> A pre-existing, formatted partition with sufficient free space is required. This could be another partition on the eMMC (e.g., a userdata partition that can be partially repurposed) or an external storage device (e.g., USB drive, NVMe SSD if the rk3588 board supports it).</li>
  <li><strong>Caution for rk3588 eMMC:</strong> Creating new partitions or resizing existing ones on the live eMMC boot device without a full re-flash (Phase 5) is highly risky and generally not recommended for embedded systems. This guide assumes the target partition <em>already exists</em> or the user is relocating to external storage. If the target is on the eMMC and needs creation/resizing, refer to Phase 5.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="methods-for-relocation"><strong>Methods for Relocation</strong></h3>

<p>Several methods can be used to relocate directories. The choice depends on the directory’s criticality and the desired level of system integration.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bind Mounts (Recommended for System Integrity):<br />
A bind mount makes a directory or an existing mount point appear as if it’s also located at another path within the filesystem hierarchy.14 The kernel treats a bind-mounted directory much like a regularly mounted filesystem, making this method generally more robust and transparent for system directories compared to symbolic links.23
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Process (e.g., relocating /var/log to /mnt/new_storage/var_log_content):</strong>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Enter Single-User Mode:</strong> To ensure no processes are actively writing to /var/log, boot into single-user mode or rescue target: sudo systemctl rescue.target or sudo init 1.18 This stops most services.</li>
          <li><strong>Create Target Directory:</strong> On the new storage location, create the directory that will hold the contents of /var/log: sudo mkdir -p /mnt/new_storage/var_log_content.</li>
          <li><strong>Copy Data:</strong> Use rsync to copy the data, preserving all attributes: sudo rsync -avX /var/log/ /mnt/new_storage/var_log_content/ The trailing slash on the source /var/log/ is important for rsync to copy the contents of the directory, not the directory itself. The -a flag archives (preserves permissions, ownership, timestamps, etc.), -v provides verbose output, and -X preserves extended attributes.14</li>
          <li><strong>Verify Copied Data:</strong> Thoroughly check that all data has been copied correctly to /mnt/new_storage/var_log_content/.</li>
          <li><strong>Rename Original Directory:</strong> Once confident in the copy, rename the original /var/log to serve as a temporary backup: sudo mv /var/log /var/log.old.</li>
          <li><strong>Create New Empty Mount Point:</strong> Create an empty directory at the original location to serve as the mount point for the bind mount: sudo mkdir /var/log.</li>
          <li><strong>Configure /etc/fstab for Permanent Mount:</strong> Add the following line to /etc/fstab to make the bind mount persistent across reboots 14: /mnt/new_storage/var_log_content /var/log none bind 0 0</li>
          <li><strong>Mount the Bind Mount:</strong> Apply the new fstab entry or mount it manually: sudo mount -a or sudo mount /var/log.</li>
          <li><strong>Verify Operation:</strong> Reboot the system. Check that /var/log is now sourced from /mnt/new_storage/var_log_content and that system logging functions correctly.</li>
          <li><strong>Remove Old Directory:</strong> Once everything is confirmed to be working correctly after a reboot and some uptime, the /var/log.old directory can be removed: sudo rm -rf /var/log.old.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Symbolic Links (Use with Caution for System Directories):<br />
A symbolic link (symlink) is a special type of file that acts as a pointer to another file or directory.17 While simpler to create than bind mounts, symlinks can sometimes cause issues with certain applications or during the early stages of the boot process, especially if they point to locations on filesystems that are not yet mounted.14
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Process (e.g., relocating /var/cache/apt/archives to /mnt/new_storage/apt_cache_content):</strong>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Create Target Directory:</strong> sudo mkdir -p /mnt/new_storage/apt_cache_content.</li>
          <li><strong>Move Data:</strong> (Ensure apt is not running) sudo mv /var/cache/apt/archives/* /mnt/new_storage/apt_cache_content/ (or use rsync then rm) sudo rmdir /var/cache/apt/archives (if empty after moving contents)</li>
          <li><strong>Create Symbolic Link:</strong> sudo ln -s /mnt/new_storage/apt_cache_content /var/cache/apt/archives.17</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>For critical system directories, bind mounts are generally preferred over symlinks due to their greater transparency and robustness.14</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Configuring apt.conf for APT Cache (Specific to APT):<br />
For /var/cache/apt/archives/, APT itself provides a configuration option to change its cache location, which is often the cleanest method.14
    <ol>
      <li>Create the new cache destination, including a partial subdirectory: sudo mkdir -p /mnt/new_storage/my_apt_cache/partial</li>
      <li>
        <p>Edit or create a custom APT configuration file, e.g., /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99custom_cache.conf:<br />
Dir::Cache::Archives “/mnt/new_storage/my_apt_cache/”;</p>
      </li>
      <li>Move existing archives (optional, or let apt clean remove old ones and new downloads go to the new location): sudo mv /var/cache/apt/archives/* /mnt/new_storage/my_apt_cache/ sudo apt clean (to clear the old default location). This method avoids filesystem-level redirection (bind mounts or symlinks) for APT’s cache.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The choice between a bind mount and a symbolic link is significant. Bind mounts are integrated at a lower level by the kernel and are generally more reliable for directories that are essential for system operation or are accessed early in the boot process (such as components of /var). Symbolic links, while simpler, might not be resolved correctly in all situations, particularly before the target filesystem is mounted or within chroot environments.14 For /var/cache/apt/archives, the apt.conf method is the most elegant and application-aware solution.</p>

<p>Regardless of the method chosen, performing these operations in single-user mode or rescue target (systemctl rescue.target) is highly recommended.18 This minimizes the risk of data corruption or service failures that could occur if files are moved while actively being used by the system.</p>

<h2 id="6-phase-5-extreme-measures---root-partition-resizing-via-re-flashing-highest-risk"><strong>6. Phase 5: Extreme Measures - Root Partition Resizing via Re-flashing (Highest Risk)</strong></h2>

<p>This phase describes the process of resizing the root partition (/dev/root) on the eMMC by modifying the device’s partition table and re-flashing the firmware. This is the most invasive and highest-risk procedure detailed in this guide and should only be considered as a last resort if all previous methods are insufficient to resolve the low space issue.</p>

<p><strong>Strong Warning:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Loss is Certain:</strong> This procedure involves re-partitioning the eMMC, which will erase all data on the partitions being modified or re-flashed. A complete and verified backup of all critical data (as outlined in Phase 1) is absolutely essential. Without it, data recovery will be impossible.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk of Bricking:</strong> Incorrect execution, such as flashing an incompatible loader, a malformed parameter file, or interrupting the flashing process, can lead to a “bricked” device, rendering it unbootable. Recovery might only be possible if MASKROM mode remains accessible.</li>
  <li><strong>Expertise Required:</strong> This operation should only be attempted by users with a thorough understanding of the Rockchip rk3588 platform, eMMC partitioning, firmware structure, and the use of flashing tools like rkdeveloptool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Directly resizing a live root partition on an eMMC device using tools like GParted (which are primarily designed for x86 systems and may not boot or function correctly on ARM SoCs for this purpose 25) is generally not feasible or safe and can lead to filesystem corruption.27 The correct method for rk3588 involves defining a new partition layout and re-flashing.</p>

<h3 id="overview-of-rk3588-emmc-partitioning"><strong>Overview of rk3588 eMMC Partitioning</strong></h3>

<p>Rockchip-based devices, including the rk3588, utilize a “parameter” file to define the partition layout on the eMMC storage.3 This text file specifies partition names, their sizes, and often their starting offsets on the eMMC. For systems using the GUID Partition Table (GPT), this file is typically named parameter-gpt.txt or similar, and will contain an entry like TYPE: GPT.29</p>

<p>The CMDLINE entry within the parameter file often contains an mtdparts string that describes the partition layout, for example: mtdparts=rk29xxnand:0x00002000@0x00004000(uboot),0x00002000@0x00006000(misc),….29 In this format, 0x&lt;hex_size&gt; represents the partition size, 0x&lt;hex_start_offset&gt; is its starting location, and (name) is the partition label. Modifying the root partition size involves carefully editing these values.</p>

<p>The primary tool for low-level interaction with Rockchip devices in MASKROM or Loader mode is rkdeveloptool.3 It is used for flashing bootloaders, the parameter file (which defines the partition table), and individual partition images.</p>

<h3 id="conceptual-steps-for-re-partitioning-and-re-flashing"><strong>Conceptual Steps for Re-partitioning and Re-flashing</strong></h3>

<p>The following steps provide a conceptual overview. Specific file names, offsets, and commands may vary based on the rk3588 board vendor and firmware version. Always refer to the official documentation for the specific device.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Obtain Necessary Files:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The correct rkdeveloptool binary for the host operating system.</li>
      <li>The appropriate loader file for the rk3588 SoC (e.g., rk3588_spl_loader_vX.Y.Z.bin, MiniLoaderAll.bin).2</li>
      <li>The parameter.txt or parameter-gpt.txt file corresponding to the device’s current firmware or a known-good base image. This file will be modified.</li>
      <li>Image files for all essential partitions: uboot.img, trust.img, boot.img (containing the kernel and device tree), and a new rootfs.img (Debian Bullseye for arm64). An image for userdata.img might also be needed, or it can be created as an empty partition to be formatted later.2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Complete eMMC Backup (Reiteration of Phase 1):</strong> Before any modification, use rkdeveloptool read-partition &lt;partition_name&gt; &lt;filename.img&gt; in MASKROM/Loader mode to back up <em>every</em> existing partition (e.g., loader, parameter, uboot, trust, boot, rootfs, userdata, and any others specific to the device). This is the most reliable way to preserve the original state.</li>
  <li><strong>Modify the parameter.txt File:</strong> This is the most critical step for resizing. Carefully edit the parameter.txt file to reflect the new desired partition sizes.
    <ul>
      <li>Identify the line defining rootfs and userdata (or any subsequent partitions).</li>
      <li>Adjust the size of rootfs. If increasing rootfs, the starting offset of userdata (and any partitions after it) must be increased accordingly. The size of userdata (or the last partition) may need to be reduced to ensure the total allocated space does not exceed the eMMC capacity.</li>
      <li>Example (conceptual, based on mtdparts format seen in 29): Original: …&lt;size_A&gt;@&lt;offset_A&gt;(partA),&lt;size_rootfs&gt;@&lt;offset_rootfs&gt;(rootfs),&lt;size_userdata&gt;@&lt;offset_userdata&gt;(userdata)… Modified: …&lt;size_A&gt;@&lt;offset_A&gt;(partA),&lt;NEW_size_rootfs&gt;@&lt;offset_rootfs&gt;(rootfs),&lt;NEW_size_userdata&gt;@&lt;NEW_offset_userdata&gt;(userdata)…</li>
      <li>All size and offset values are typically in hexadecimal and may represent sectors (512 bytes) or blocks of a different size. This must be handled with extreme precision. Ensure partitions are contiguous and do not overlap.</li>
      <li>Modifying the parameter file incorrectly is a primary cause of flashing failures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prepare a New rootfs.img:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the rootfs partition size is changing, the original rootfs.img (even if backed up) might not be suitable. Flashing an old, smaller rootfs.img to a newly enlarged partition will result in unused space within that partition.</li>
      <li>Ideally, obtain or build a fresh Debian Bullseye arm64 rootfs.img that is either pre-sized for the new larger partition or is a minimal image that can be expanded post-flash.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enter MASKROM/Loader Mode:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect the rk3588 device to the host PC via USB OTG.</li>
      <li>Follow the device-specific procedure to boot into MASKROM or Loader mode (e.g., holding the RECOVERY button while powering on or pressing RESET 1). The host PC should detect a new USB device.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Flash with rkdeveloptool:</strong> The sequence of commands is critical:
    <ul>
      <li>Download initial bootloader (SPL): sudo rkdeveloptool db &lt;loader_file.bin&gt;.3</li>
      <li>(Optional, device-dependent) Upgrade loader/write IDB loader: sudo rkdeveloptool ul &lt;loader_file.bin&gt;.3</li>
      <li>Write the modified partition table: sudo rkdeveloptool gpt &lt;modified_parameter-gpt.txt&gt;.3 (Some tools might use rkdeveloptool write-partition-table &lt;modified_parameter.txt&gt;).</li>
      <li>Flash individual partition images to their new offsets as defined in the modified parameter file. The command can be rkdeveloptool wl &lt;hex_offset&gt; &lt;image_file.img&gt; or rkdeveloptool write-partition &lt;partition_name&gt; &lt;image_file.img&gt; if the tool can parse names from the parameter file.3
        <ul>
          <li>sudo rkdeveloptool write-partition uboot uboot.img</li>
          <li>sudo rkdeveloptool write-partition trust trust.img</li>
          <li>sudo rkdeveloptool write-partition boot boot.img</li>
          <li>sudo rkdeveloptool write-partition rootfs &lt;new_rootfs.img&gt;</li>
          <li>sudo rkdeveloptool write-partition userdata userdata.img (if flashing userdata)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Reset the device: sudo rkdeveloptool rd.3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Post-Flash Operations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The first boot after re-flashing may take longer as the system initializes.</li>
      <li>If a generic or smaller rootfs.img was flashed to the newly enlarged rootfs partition, the filesystem within it will need to be resized to utilize the full space. Once the system boots, this can often be done with sudo resize2fs /dev/root (or the actual block device for the rootfs, e.g., /dev/mmcblkXpY). This command expands an ext2/3/4 filesystem to fill the partition it resides on.27</li>
      <li>Restore user data and system configurations from the backups made in Phase 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Understanding the role of each partition is vital when modifying the parameter file and flashing. Omitting a critical partition or flashing it to the wrong location will likely result in an unbootable device.</p>

<p>The process of resizing the root partition on an rk3588’s eMMC is fundamentally a firmware re-flashing operation that rewrites the partition table based on a modified parameter file. This is distinct from live partition resizing common on x86 systems. The parameter file acts as the blueprint for the eMMC’s structure, and any changes to it necessitate re-flashing not only the partition table itself but also all essential bootloader stages and operating system images to ensure their correct placement and function according to the new layout. This interdependency means that a change in the parameter file (the cause) requires a comprehensive re-flash of related components (the effect) for the system to boot and operate correctly.</p>

<h2 id="7-phase-6-post-resolution-monitoring-and-best-practices"><strong>7. Phase 6: Post-Resolution Monitoring and Best Practices</strong></h2>

<p>After successfully implementing one or more of the preceding phases to alleviate the low disk space issue on the /dev/root partition, it is crucial to verify the results and establish practices for ongoing monitoring and prevention.</p>

<h3 id="verifying-reclaimed-space"><strong>Verifying Reclaimed Space</strong></h3>

<p>Immediately after completing any cleanup, relocation, or re-flashing procedures, verify the amount of space reclaimed on the root partition. Use the df -Th command:<br />
df -Th /<br />
or<br />
df -Th /dev/root<br />
Compare the “Avail” and “Use%” columns with the values recorded in Phase 1 to quantify the improvement.</p>

<h3 id="ongoing-disk-space-monitoring"><strong>Ongoing Disk Space Monitoring</strong></h3>

<p>Proactive monitoring is key to preventing future low-space emergencies.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regular Manual Checks:</strong> Periodically run df -h and, if necessary, sudo ncdu -x / to keep an eye on disk space consumption trends.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated Monitoring/Alerts:</strong> For systems in continuous operation, consider implementing automated monitoring scripts or tools (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix, or custom scripts using cron) that can send alerts if disk usage on /dev/root exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 80% or 85%).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preventative-measures-for-the-future"><strong>Preventative Measures for the Future</strong></h3>

<p>Adopting good system hygiene practices can significantly reduce the likelihood of the root partition filling up again.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regular System Maintenance:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Periodically execute sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt clean &amp;&amp; sudo apt autoremove --purge to remove cached package files and orphaned dependencies.</li>
      <li>Routinely check and manage old kernels if apt autoremove is not consistently effective.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Log Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure systemd-journald is configured with appropriate size limits (e.g., SystemMaxUse) in /etc/systemd/journald.conf to prevent unbounded growth of system logs.</li>
      <li>Verify that logrotate is active and correctly configured for other application logs in /var/log/.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mindful Software Installation and Usage:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Be cautious when installing large software packages, especially from third-party sources or compiled manually. Understand where they store their data and cache.</li>
      <li>If applications allow, configure them to use alternative storage locations (e.g., a separate userdata partition or external storage) for large datasets, caches, or temporary files, rather than the root partition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Developer Practices (if applicable):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>For users developing applications for the rk3588 platform, profile resource consumption, including disk space usage, during development and testing. Optimize applications to minimize their storage footprint on the root filesystem.</li>
      <li>Avoid storing large, volatile data directly within the application’s installation directory on the root partition if it can be placed on a more suitable data partition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By addressing the immediate low space problem and implementing these preventative measures, the long-term stability and performance of the rk3588 Debian Bullseye system can be significantly enhanced. This transforms a reactive troubleshooting effort into a proactive system administration strategy.</p>

  <li><strong>Board Vendor Wikis:</strong> Manufacturers like Radxa, FriendlyElec, Orange Pi, etc., provide detailed wikis and documentation for their rk3588-based boards (e.g.2).</li>
  <li><strong>Rockchip Open Source Wiki:</strong> opensource.rock-chips.com (or similar official Rockchip developer sites) often contain core documentation about SoCs and tools.3</li>
  <li><strong>Community Forums:</strong> Forums associated with the board vendor (e.g., Radxa Forum 42) or broader Arm/Linux communities (e.g., Armbian forums, if applicable) can be invaluable for troubleshooting and sharing experiences.43</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="troubleshooting-common-issues"><strong>Troubleshooting Common Issues</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>rkdeveloptool Fails to Detect Device:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the device is correctly put into MASKROM or Loader mode. The procedure can be timing-sensitive.</li>
      <li>Verify USB OTG cable and port are functional.</li>
      <li>On Linux hosts, ensure udev rules are correctly set up for Rockchip devices, or run rkdeveloptool with sudo.</li>
      <li>On Windows hosts, ensure the correct Rockchip USB drivers are installed.1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>System Fails to Boot After Kernel Removal:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If too many kernels were removed, or the only remaining kernel is faulty, the system may not boot.</li>
      <li>Recovery might involve booting from an SD card (if supported by the board and U-Boot) into a compatible Linux environment. From there, it might be possible to mount the eMMC root partition, chroot into it, and reinstall a known-good kernel package (linux-image-…). This is an advanced procedure.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, re-flashing the boot and rootfs partitions via MASKROM mode might be necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Errors During apt Operations:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Network issues: Ensure the device has internet connectivity.</li>
      <li>Corrupted package lists: Try sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* followed by sudo apt update.</li>
      <li>Broken packages: sudo apt --fix-broken install might resolve some dependency issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9-conclusions-and-recommendations"><strong>9. Conclusions and Recommendations</strong></h2>

<p>The issue of low disk space on the /dev/root partition of an rk3588 arm64 Debian Bullseye system, while critical, can be systematically addressed. This guide has outlined a phased approach, starting with low-risk cleanup operations and progressing to more complex and potentially risky procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Key Recommendations:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Prioritize Safety:</strong> Before undertaking any significant modifications, especially those involving directory relocation (Phase 4) or eMMC re-partitioning (Phase 5), <strong>a comprehensive data backup is non-negotiable</strong>. Understanding the MASKROM/Loader mode recovery process for the specific rk3588 device is also a crucial preparatory step.</li>
  <li><strong>Start with Low-Risk Methods:</strong> Always begin with standard system cleanup procedures outlined in Phase 2. Utilizing apt clean and apt autoremove --purge, managing old Linux kernels carefully, and controlling systemd journal log sizes can often free up substantial space with minimal risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze Before Acting:</strong> Employ tools like ncdu (Phase 3) to accurately identify the largest consumers of disk space. This targeted analysis will inform which specific directories or file types are the primary cause of the low space condition, allowing for more effective remediation.</li>
  <li><strong>Approach Directory Relocation with Caution:</strong> If relocating directories (Phase 4) is deemed necessary, prefer bind mounts over symbolic links for system-critical directories due to their enhanced robustness. Always perform such operations in single-user mode or rescue target to ensure system stability. For specific cases like the APT cache, application-level configurations (e.g., apt.conf) are the preferred method.</li>
  <li><strong>Reserve Partition Resizing as a Last Resort:</strong> Re-flashing the eMMC to resize partitions (Phase 5) is a high-risk operation that guarantees data loss on affected partitions and can render the device unbootable if not executed perfectly. This should only be attempted if all other methods fail and the user possesses the necessary expertise and has exhausted all other options. Meticulous adherence to the rk3588 platform’s specific flashing procedures, including correct modification of the parameter file and use of rkdeveloptool, is essential.</li>
  <li><strong>Implement Proactive Monitoring and Maintenance:</strong> Once the immediate space issue is resolved, establish a routine of ongoing disk space monitoring and preventative maintenance (Phase 6). Regular cleanups, log management, and mindful software installation will help prevent recurrence of the problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>By following this structured approach, users can effectively manage and resolve low disk space issues on their rk3588 Debian Bullseye systems, ensuring continued stability and performance. The specific nature of embedded ARM SoCs like the rk3588 necessitates a greater degree of caution and platform-specific knowledge compared to managing disk space on standard desktop systems.</p>

**NAME**
**ratpoison** — window manager without mouse dependency
**SYNOPSIS**
**ratpoison** [**−hv**] **ratpoison** [**−d**_dpy_] [**−s**_num_] [**−f**_file_] **ratpoison** [**−d**_dpy_] [**−s**_num_] [**−i**] **−c**_command_ [**−c**_command ..._]
**DESCRIPTION**
**ratpoison** is a Window Manager without fat library dependencies, fancy graphics or rat dependence.
The screen can be split into non-overlapping frames. All windows are kept maximized inside their frames.
All interaction with the window manager is done through keystrokes. **ratpoison** has a prefix map to minimize key clobbering.
The options are as follows:
**−c**, **−−command**
Send ratpoison a command. There must be a ratpoison instance running as window manager for the given display/screen for this to work. Do not forget to quote the command if it contains spaces. For example:
**ratpoison −c** "_echo hello world_"
**−d**, **−−display**_display_
Set the X display to use or send commands to.
**−f**, **−−file**_filename_
Specify an alternate configuration file. If this is not given, **ratpoison** will try _$HOME/.ratpoisonrc_ and if that does not exist _/etc/ratpoisonrc_ and execute each command when starting up.
**−h**, **−−help**
Show summary of options.
**−i**, **−−interactive**
Execute commands given with **−c** or **−−command** in interactive mode. That means it will behave exactly as if called with **C−t :** like prompting for missing arguments and things like that.
**−s**, **−−screen**_number_
Only use the specified screen.
**−v**, **−−version**
Show version of program.
**KEY BINDINGS**
To avoid conflicts with other programs, all default ratpoison key bindings start with an escape key, per default **C−t** (read Control−t). Some important default key bindings:
**C−t ?**
Show key bindings
**C−t c**
Start an X terminal
**C−t n**
Switch to next window
**C−t p**
Switch to previous window
**C−t 1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9**
Switch to window number 1 | 2 | ...
**C−t k**
Close the current window
**C−t K**
XKill the current application
**C−t s** | **S**
Split the current frame into two vertical | horizontal ones
**C−t Tab** | **Left** | **Up** | **Right** | **Down**
Switch to the next | left | top | right | bottom frame.
**C−t Q**
Make the current frame the only one
**C−t :**
Execute a ratpoison command
Further default key bindings can be found in parentheses after the commands in the next section.
**COMMANDS AND DEFAULT ALIASES
 abort**
(**C−t C−g**) Do nothing and that successfully. (
Useful if you pressed **C−t** in error ).
**addhook**_event command_
Add a hook: run _command_ whenever _event_ is called. Possible events are:
**deletewindow**
Run after a window is withdrawn.
**newwindow**
Run after a new window is mapped.
**key**
Run whenever a top level key is pressed (by default **C−t**).
**quit**
Run before exiting **ratpoison**.
**restart**
Run before restarting **ratpoison**.
**switchframe**
Run after a frame actually switched, but before the window in it is focused.
**switchgroup**
Run after selecting a new group.
**switchscreen**
Run when the user switches to a different screen.
**switchwin**
Run after a new window is selected. (With dedication, it may already be inactive again, if it was put into another frame)
**alias**_alias command_
Add _alias_ as new way to call _command_.
**bind**_key command_
alias for "**definekey root**_key command_"
**banish**
(**C−t b**) Banish the rat cursor to the lower right corner of the screen.
**banishrel**
Banish the rat cursor to the lower right corner of the current window. If there isn’t a window in the current frame, it banishes the rat cursor to the lower right corner of the frame.
**chdir** [_directory_]
If the optional argument is given, change the current directory of **ratpoison** to _directory_. If nothing is given, change it to the value of the environment variable "HOME".
**clrunmanaged**
Clears the unmanaged window list.
**cnext**
Like **next** but switch to the next window with another resource class than the current one. (That means the next window belonging to another type of application than the current one.)
**cprev**
Like **prev** but switch to the previous window with another resource class than the current one. (That means the previous window belonging to another type of application than the current one.)
**colon**_ratpoison−command_ (**C−t :**)
Execute _ratpoison−command_ interactively. (i.e. ask for possible missing arguments.)
**cother**
Like **other** but switch to the window of the current group that was last accessed and has another resource class but is not currently visible.
**curframe** (**C−t F**)
Show a bar marking the current frame.
**definekey**_keymap key command_
Add a new key binding in _keymap_ for _key_ to execute _command_. Default keymaps are top normally only containing **C−t**, which reads a key from root, containing all the normal commands.
Note that you have to describe ":" by "colon", "!" by "exclam" and so on. If you cannot guess a name of a key, try either **C−t**_key_ and look at the error message, or try **:describekey** root and pressing the key.
**dedicate** [**0** | **1**]
Consider the current frame dedicated/chaste (**1**) or promiscuous (**0**).
A dedicated frame will not accept new windows. When new windows are to be focused, they will be opened in a non-dedicated frame instead.
If no argument is given, toggle the current dedicateness. By default no windows are dedicated.
**delete** (**C−t k**)
Close the current window.
**delkmap**_keymap_
Deletes the keymap named _keymap_, that was generated with **newkmap**. The keymaps top (or whatever was specified by **set**_topkmap_) and root cannot be deleted.
**describekey**_keymap_
Grab the next key. Similar to **readkey**, **describekey** shows only the command in _keymap_, that would be executed by **readkey**.
**echo**_text_
Show _text_ as **ratpoison** message.
**escape**_key_
Update the default escape key to _key_.
Strictly speaking it updates the **readkey root** command in the keymap **top** to _key_, the **other** binding in root to _key_, and **meta** binding in root to _key_ without modifiers or **C−**_key_ if _key_ has no modifiers. (If **set topkmap** was called with an argument other than **top** that will be used instead of **top**.)
**exchangedown** (**C−t C−Down**)
Exchange the window in the current frame with the window in the frame below the current frame.
**exchangeleft** (**C−t C−Left**)
Exchange the window in the current frame with the window in the frame left of the current frame.
**exchangeright** (**C−t C−Right**)
Exchange the window in the current frame with the window in the frame right of the current frame.
**exchangeup** (**C−t C−Up**)
Exchange the window in the current frame with the window in the frame above the current frame.
**exec**_shell−command_ (**C−t !**)
Spawn a shell executing _shell−command_.
**execa**_shell−command_
Spawn a shell executing _shell−command_, without remembering the current frame, so that _NET_WM_PID declaring programs will be placed into the frame active when they open a window instead of the frame active when **ratpoison** gets this command.
**execf**_frame shell−command_
Spawn a shell executing _shell−command_, showing _NET_WM_PID supporting programs in the given frame instead of the frame selected when this program is run.
**fdump** [_screenno_]
Output the defining data for all frames of the current screen, or for screen number _screenno_ if this is specified.
**focus** (**C−t Tab**)
Focus the next frame.
**focuslast**
Switch to the last selected focus.
**focusleft** (**C−t Left**)
Switch to the frame to the left of the current one.
**focusdown** (**C−t Down**)
Switch to the frame beneath the current one.
**focusright** (**C−t Right**)
Switch to the frame to the right of the current one.
**focusprev**
Focus the previous frame.
**focusup** (**C−t Up**)
Switch to the frame above the current one.
**frestore**_frames_
Replace the current frames with the ones specified in _frames_ in the format as generated by **fdump**.
**fselect** [ _frameno_] (**C−t f**)
If an argument is supplied, switch to a frame given by number _frameno_.
If no argument is given, show a frame selector in each frame and wait for a key to be pressed. If the key matches an existing frame selector, this frame gets focused.
Frame selectors are by default the numbers starting with zero, but they can be changed by **set**ting _framesels_.
**gdelete** [_group_]
If the optional argument _group_ is supplied, delete _group_. Otherwise delete the current group. If the last group is deleted, a new group with name default is created. The group has to be empty, otherwise it cannot be deleted.
**getenv**_variable_
Output the value of the environment variable _variable_.
**getsel**
Paste the current X Selection into the current window.
**gmerge**_group_
Move all windows from group _group_ into the current group.
**gmove**_group_
Move the current window into group _group_.
**gnew**_group_
Create a new group with name _group_ and select it. Most window commands only see (and thus select, consider next, previous or last) windows within the group active when they are issued.
**gnewbg**_group_
Create a new group named _group_, but do not select it.
**gnext**
Select the next group. Most window commands only see windows in the effective group.
**gnumber** [_old new_]
Give the number _new_ to the group with the number _old_ or the current group.
**gother**
Select the last accessed group. Most window commands only see windows in the effective group.
**gprev**
Select the prior group. Most window commands only see windows in the effective group.
**gravity** [**nw** | **w** | **sw** | **n** | **c** | **s** | **ne** | **e** | **se**]
Change how in its frame the current window is aligned.
**grename**
Rename current group.
**groups**
Output a list of all groups with their number.
**gselect**_group_
Select the group named _group_.
**help** [_keymap_]
If the optional parameter _keymap_ is given, list all keybindings in this keymap, otherwise list all key bindings in keymap root.
**hsplit** [ _l_**/**_p_ | [ **−**]_pixels_] (**C−t S**)
Split the current frame into left frame and a right frame. If no parameter is given, split in halves. If two numbers separated by a slash (‘/’) are given, the left one is _l_ times the _p_ th part and the right one (_p_ − _l_) times the _p_ th part of the prior width. Otherwise the right half is _pixels_ wide or the left one is _pixels_ wide, depending whether there is ‘−’ in front of the number or not.
**inext**
Like **next** but switch to the next window with the same resource class as the current one. (That means the next window belonging to the same application as the current one.)
**info** (**C−t i**)
Output the current the width, height, window number and window name of the current window. (
What name means is chosen by ‘‘**set**_winname_’’. )
**iprev**
Like **prev** but switch to the previous window with the same resource class as the current one. (That means the previous window belonging to the same application as the current one.)
**iother**
Like **other** but switch to the window of the current group that was last accessed and has the same resource class but is not currently visible.
**kill** (**C−t K**)
Close the X-connection of the X-client responsible for the current window.
**lastmsg** (**C−t m**)
Reshow the last message.
**license** (**C−t V**)
Show **ratpoison**’s license.
**link**_key_ [_keymap_]
Do what _key_ is bound to in the keymap _keymap_ if supplied. Otherwise what _key_ is bound to in keymap root.
**listhook**_event_
List all commands specified with **addhook** to be executed when even _event_ occurs.
**meta** [ _key_] (**C−t t**)
Send the escape key (that which normally is **C−t**) to the current window. If a _key_ is specified, this is sent instead. Note that some applications by default ignore the synthetic key that is sent using this command as it is considered a security hole. xterm is one such application.
**msgwait** [_seconds_]
Set the duration the message window is shown. If _seconds_ is zero, wait infinitely. This command is deprecated, please set the _msgwait_ variable instead.
**newkmap**_keymap_
Generate a new keymap named _keymap_. This keymap can be used to add new key-command mappings to it with **definekey** and can be called with **readkey**.
**newwm**_new-window-manager_
Quit **ratpoison** and execute _new-window-manager_ instead.
**next** (**C−t Return** | **C−t n** | **C−t space**)
Switch to the next window in the current group.

Switch to the previous window in the current group.
**prevscreen** (**C−t P**)
Switch to the previous screen. (If you have multiple physical ones.)
**prompt** [_prompt_]
**ratpoison** will ask the user for input, showing _prompt_ (or a single colon, if no argument is given) and output the input the user has made. Note that this command probably does not make much sense in interactive mode.
**putsel**_x−selection_
Replace the X selection with the text _x−selection_. It can be inserted into the current window with **getsel**.
Quit **ratpoison**.
**ratinfo**
Display the x y coordinates of the rat cursor relative to the screen.
**ratrelinfo**
Display the x y coordinates of the rat cursor relative to the current window or current frame if no window is focused
**ratwarp**_x y_
Move the rat cursor to the position (_x_, _y_).
**ratrelwarp**_deltax deltay_
Move the rat cursor to (_deltax_, _deltay_), relative to the current position.

Simulate a rat click with _button_ (button 1=left button if none given).
**rathold** { **up** | **down**} [_button_]
Simulate pressing|releasing rat button _button_ (1=left button if none given).
**readkey**_keymap_
Grab the next key pressed, and execute the command associated to this key in _keymap_. To show it is waiting for a key, **ratpoison** will change the rat cursor to a square if _waitcursor_ is set. This command is perhaps best described with its usage in the default configuration: by pressing **C−t**, which is the only key in the keymap top , the command "**readkey root**" is executed. The next key then executes the command in keymap root belonging to this command.
**redisplay** (**C−t l**)
Extend the current window to the whole size of its current frame and redisplay it. (Useful to redisplay normal windows or bring transient windows to the full size of the frame as only normal windows are maximized by **ratpoison**)
**redo** (**C−t U**)
Revert the last **undo** of frame changes.
**remhook**_event command_
Remove command _command_ from the list of commands to be called when event _event_ is hit. (The command has to specified, as an event can have multiple commands attached to it.) Use "**listhook**_hook_" to get a list of all attached commands.
**remove** (**C−t R**)
Remove the current frame and extend some frames around to fill the remaining gap.
**removedown** (**C−t M−Down**)
Kill frames directly below the current frame, extending the current frame as much as possible.
**removeleft** (**C−t M−Left**)
Kill frames directly left of the current frame, extending the current frame as much as possible.

Kill frames directly above the current frame, extending the current frame as much as possible.
**removeright** (**C−t M−Right**)
Kill frames directly right of the current frame, extending the current frame as much as possible.
**resize** [ _deltax deltay_] (**C−t r**)
If _deltax_ and _deltay_ are supplied, resize the current frame by that (i.e. move the bottom right corner by the given offsets and then move this frame and resize adjacent frames to make the frames fill the whole screen again.)
If in interactive mode no arguments are supplied, resize the current frame interactively:
**Return**
finish resizing
**C−g**, **Escape**
abort resizing
**C−n**, **Down**, **j**
grow vertically
**C−p**, **Up**, **k**
shrink vertically
**C−f**, **Right**, **l**
grow horizontally
**C−b**, **Up**, **h**

While resizing interactively, changes are in multiples of the amount of pixels given by **set resizeunit** (by default 10).
Restart **ratpoison**.
**rudeness** [_rudeness_]
This command is deprecated, please use the _rudeness_ variable instead.
**sdump**
Output the list of all screens. The screens are separated by commas. Each screen is shown as 6 values: its number, its x-coordinate, its y-coordinate, its width, its height and if it is currently selected (1=true, 0=false).
**select** { **−** | _name_ | _number_} (**C−t ’**)
If a number is given, switch to the window with number _number_. If a name is given, switch to the window in the current group with name _name_. Blank the current frame, if **−** is given.
**set** [_variable_ [_value_]]
If no argument is given, output all **ratpoison** variables and their values.
If one argument is given, output the value of **ratpoison** variable _variable_. Otherwise set _variable_ to _value_. What values are valid depends on the variable. See the section _VARIABLES_ later in this document for details.
**setenv**_variable value_
Set the environment variable _variable_ to _value_. (
Environment variables will be passed to all programs started from **ratpoison**. )
**sfdump**
Output all frames similar to **fdump**, but not limited to one screen, but all screens at once and with the screen number after each frame.
**sfrestore**_frames_
Replace the current frames with the ones specified in _frames_ in the format as generated by **sfdump**.

**undefinekey**_keymap key_
Remove the binding for _key_ from _keymap_.
**undo** (**C−t _**, **C−t u**)
Un−do the last change to the frameset. (Like splitting, resizing, deleting, ...)
The amount of steps that can be undone is specified by the variable _maxundos_.
**unmanage** [_name_]
Add _name_ to the list of unmanaged windows. Thus, windows of this name will not be managed but allowed to choose their position themselves.
In non−interactive mode calling it without arguments will print the list.
The list can be cleared again by calling **clrunmanaged**.

If two numbers separated by a slash (‘‘/’’) are given, the upper one is _l_ times the _p_ th part and the lower one (_p_ − _l_) times the _p_ th part of the prior height. Otherwise the lower one is _pixels from bottom_ wide or the upper one _pixels from top_ high, depending whether there is a ‘‘−’’ in front of the number or not.
**warp** {**on** | **off**}
Select if focusing a window moves the rat cursor to the place it had been last time this window was focused, or not. This command is deprecated, please set the _warp_ variable instead.
**windows** [ _format_] (**C−t w**)
In interactive mode, show the list of all windows in the current group for the duration specified by the variable _msgwait_. If _msgwait_ was zero, toggle between indefinitely showing and not showing.

@chapter About
ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library dependencies,
no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no rodent dependence. It
is largely modeled after GNU Screen which has done wonders in the
virtual terminal market.
All interaction with the window manager is done through
keystrokes. ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering
that cripples Emacs and other quality pieces of software.
ratpoison was written by Shawn Betts (@email{sabetts@@gmail.com}).

@node Concepts
@chapter Concepts
ratpoison uses the concept of @dfn{panes} to place and size
windows. Instead of allowing windows to have arbitary shapes at
arbitary locations on the screen, the display is divided into panes,
the same way a physical window might contain several pieces of glass
seperated by wood. In ratpoison, the panes are called @dfn{frames},
and windows are placed in them, maximised. ratpoison starts with one
frame, which can be split into an arbitary number of smaller
ones. Each frame can be split in half either horizontally or
vertically. You can move among them, making different ones the
current. For more information, see @ref{Splitting Frames}.
Each frame has at most one window associated with it, which is visible
in that frame. If you select a window that is associated with a frame,
the focus will move to its associated frame, rather than moving the
window to the current frame. If you select a window that is not
associated with a frame, that window will be opened in the current
frame and resized to fit that frame.
If the window associated with a frame does not fill the frame
completely, the various gravity commands control how it is placed.
If no window was open in that frame before the current window was
opened, the X root will be visible behind it.
Transient windows (dialog boxes, splash screens, and the like) are
handled specially. In order to understand the contents of a transient
window, the previously focused window is often required. Take a search
window, it is useful to be able to see the document you are searching
as well as the search window. For this reason transient windows appear
overtop (according to their gravity) of the previously focused window.
Every window belongs in a group. A group is simply that: a group of
windows. By default there is only one group (the @dfn{default group})
that all windows exist in. You can create new groups. When a program
creates a window it will be added to the current group. Groups are
generally used to organize windows into different classes such as work
and wasting-time-at-work.
@node General Use
@chapter General Use
When ratpoison starts you should see an empty X server. To open an x
terminal hit @kbd{C-t c}. You can now run shell commands as you would on
any terminal. Notice the terminal maximized full screen. @kbd{C-t !}
will run a single shell command and saves you the effort of opening a
terminal.
Once you have a couple X programs running, you'll want to navigate
between windows. To see what windows are being managed hit @kbd{C-t
w}. Each window has a number. You can jump to a window by hitting
@kbd{C-t} followed by the window's number. This assumes the window's
number is one digit. You can also switch to a window by typing in part
of its name. To do this hit @kbd{C-t '}.
ratpoison allows you to cycle through the windows with @kbd{C-t n}
and @kbd{C-t p}.
And that concludes a brief introduction on how to use ratpoison. Notice
how we didn't have to drag a single window, or click a single maximize
button? Beautiful wasn't it? Felt fast? Cool? It's modern computing at
its best.
@node Windows
@chapter Windows
Windows are what ratpoison manages.
@node Manipulating Windows
@section Manipulating Windows
The following are commands used to manipulate windows.
@deffn Command select @var{n}
This jumps you to window @var{n} where @var{n} is the window number as
shown in the Program Bar. You can do the same trick with
@kbd{C-@var{n}} too. To select no window, blanking the current
frame, type @samp{select -}.
@end deffn
@deffn Command select @var{window-name}
Go to a window by name. A shortcut is @kbd{C-t '}.
@deffn Command windows @var{fmt}
This displays the Program Bar which displays the windows you currently
have running. The number before each window name is used to jump to
that window. You can do this by typing @kbd{C-t @var{n}} where @var{n}
is the number of the window. Note that only windows with numbers from
0 to 9 can be referenced using this keystroke.  To reach windows with
numbers greater than 9, use @kbd{C-t '} and type the number at the
prompt.
After 5 seconds the Program Bar disappears.
This command is bound to @kbd{C-t w} by default.
When invoked from the command-line like this,
@example
$ ratpoison -c windows
@end example
Instead of a message bar, you will get a list of the windows printed
to stdout. This allows you to write more advanced scripts than simple
keyboard macros. This is where @var{fmt} comes into play. If
@command{windows} is given an argument it treats it as the format string as
described in @command{set winfmt}.
@deffn Command title @var{title}
Rename the currently active window. This name will remain for the
duration of the window's life, unless you change it again. By default,
the @kbd{C-t A} keystroke is bound to this command.
@deffn Command other
This toggles between the current window and the last window. By
default, this is bound to @kbd{C-t C-t}.
@deffn Command prev
This jumps you to the previous window in the window list. By default,
this is bound to @kbd{C-t p}.
@deffn Command next
This jumps you to the next window in the window list. This one is
bound to three keystrokes, namely @kbd{C-t n}, @kbd{C-t space},
and @kbd{C-t enter}.
@deffn Command kill
This destroys the current window. Normally you should only need to
use @command{delete}, but just in case you need to rip the heart out of a
misbehaving window this command should do the trick. Also available as
@kbd{C-t K}.
@deffn Command info @var{fmt}
Display information about the current window. At optional @var{fmt}
argument can be passed to override the default format. @command{info}
accepts the same format options as @command{windows}.
@deffn Command gravity @var{g}
Change the gravity of the current window. A normal window will default
to the top-left corner of the screen, but it can also be placed at the
bottom-right corner of the screen. Valid values for @var{g} are the 8
directions @samp{northwest}, @samp{north}, @samp{northeast},
@samp{east}, @samp{southeast}, @samp{south}, @samp{southwest} and
@samp{west}, clockwise from the top left corner. @samp{center} will
center the window in the frame. @var{g} and can be abbreviated to the
standard compass 1 and 2 letter abbreviations (i.e. @samp{nw},
@samp{s}, etc).
When called with no arguments, the current setting is
returned.
@deffn Command delete
This deletes the current window. You can access it with the @kbd{C-t k}
keystroke.
@deffn Command {set infofmt} @var{fmt}
Set the default window format for the @command{info} command. See
@command{set winfmt} for accepted format characters.
@deffn Command {set warp} @var{n}
Set rat warping. By default this variable is set (@code{1}) and
ratpoison saves the position of the rat when leaving a window and when
the user returns to the window the rat's position is restored. If you
find this counter-intuitive, set this variable to @code{0}.
When called with no arguments, the current setting is returned.
@deffn Command {set winname} @var{name}
There are three resources ratpoison can get a window's name from: the
WMNAME hint, the res_name from the WMCLASS hint, or the res_class from
the WMCLASS hint. @var{name} can be @samp{title} which is what most
window managers put in the title bar, @samp{name} which is the
res_name, or @samp{class} which is the res_class.
@deffn Command {set wingravity} @var{g}
Set the default gravity for normal windows. See the
@command{gravity} command.
@deffn Command {set winliststyle} @var{setting}
The window list can be displayed in a row or a column. @var{setting}
can be @samp{row} or @samp{column}.
@deffn Command {set winfmt} @var{fmt}
Set the default window format for the @command{windows} command. By
default it is @samp{%n%s%t}. The following is a list of valid format
characters:
@table @samp
@item %a
Application Name
@item %c
Resource Class
@item %f
The frame number the window is displayed in or a space if it is not in
a frame.
@item %g
The window's gravity setting
@item %h
The window's height
@item %H
The window's height increment hint.
@item %i
X11 Window ID
@item %l
A unique number based on when the window was last accessed. The higher
the number, the more recently it was accessed.
@item %n
The window number
@item %p
Process ID ('?' if _NET_WM_PID isn't set)
@item %s
Window status (current window, last window, etc)
@item %S
The window's screen
@item %t
Window Name
@item %T
Whether the window is a transient or not.
@item %M
Whether the window is a maxsize window or not.
@item %w
The window's width
@item %W
The window's width increment hint
@item %x
the window's xrandr screen
@end table
Additionally there can be a number between the percent sign and the format
character, denoting a maximum length this value is to truncate to, e.g. @samp{%n%s%20t}.
@deffn Command number @var{n} @var{target}
Set a window's number to @var{n}. If another window occupies the
requested number already, then the windows' numbers are swapped.
The second argument, @var{target}, is optional. It should be the
number of the window whose number will be changed. If @var{target} is
omitted ratpoison defaults to the current window.
@deffn Command {set transgravity} @var{g}
Set the default alignment for transient windows. See the
@deffn Command {set maxsizegravity} @var{g}
Set the default alignment for windows with maxsize hints. See the
@deffn Command {set border} @var{n}
Set the border width for all windows.
@deffn Command {set onlyborder} @var{n}
Allows hiding of borders when only one frame is on the current
screen. The argument @var{n} can be @code{1} (default) which shows
borders or @code{0} which hides them for single frames.
@node Window Classes
@section Window Classes
Window classes are a way of grouping windows together. Windows that
are part of the same program generally have the same class. Ratpoison
takes advantage of this to help you navigate between windows of the
same class. This is useful if you only want to cycle through Emacs
frames or XTerms.
@deffn Command inext
Go to the next window in the window list that is in the same class as
the current window.
@deffn Command iprev
Go to the previous window in the window list that is in the same class
as the current window.
@deffn Command iother
Go to the last accessed window that is in the same class as the
current window.
@deffn Command cnext
Go to the next window in the window list that is in a different class
from the current window.
@deffn Command cprev
Go to the previous window in the window list that is in a different
class from the current window.
@deffn Command cother
Go to the last accessed window that is in a different class from the
@node Unmanaged Windows
@section Unmanaged Windows
ratpoison can intentionally not manage windows. ratpoison keeps a list
of strings and if any new window's name matches a string in the list,
then it will not be picked up and managed by ratpoison.
The following are commands to manipulate this list
@deffn Command clrunmanaged
Clear the unmanaged window list.
@deffn Command unmanage @var{text}
Add @var{text} to the unmanaged window list. Any window whose name
matches any of the strings in the unmanaged window list will not be
handled in any way by ratpoison. This only applies to new windows (not
windows already managed by ratpoison).
When called with no arguments, the list is returned.
@node Rudeness
@section Rudeness
Some programs will attempt to steal the focus without the users
permission. Not only is this a sign of a lame programmers attempt to fix
a window manager problem in the wrong place, it's just plain rude. By
default ratpoison will honour these rudeness requests, but it doesn't
have to. Use the rudeness variable to deal with such programs.
@deffn Command {set rudeness} @var{n}
The rudeness variable lets you decide what windows pop-up
automatically and when. This is often useful for those deep hack
sessions when you absolutely can't be disturbed.
There are two kinds of windows: normal windows (like an xterm) and
transient windows (generally pop-up dialog boxes). When a client
program wants to display a new window it makes a requests to
ratpoison. ratpoison then decides whether to grant the request and
display the window or ignore it. A client program can also request
that one of its windows be raised. You can customize ratpoison to
either honour these requests (the default operation) or ignore them.
@var{n} is a number from 0 to 15. Each of the four bits determine
which requests ratpoison grants.
@table @asis
@item Bit 0
Tells ratpoison to grant raise requests on transient windows
@item Bit 1
Tells ratpoison to grant raise requests on normal windows
@item Bit 2
Tells ratpoison to grant display requests on new transient windows
@item Bit 3
Tells ratpoison to grant display requests on new normal windows
For example, if you wanted only wanted to grant transient windows
raise requests and display requests you would type @samp{set rudeness
5}.
If a request is not granted ratpoison will tell you about the
request with a message like @samp{Raise request from window 1
(emacs)}.
@node Groups
@chapter Groups
ratpoison provides functionality to group windows together. This
coupled with saving and restoring frames configurations is what most
people would call @dfn{virtual desktops} or @dfn{workspaces}.
While ratpoison doesn't explicitly provide support for such things, it
does allow you to write scripts to this end. Such a script exists in
@file{contrib/} called @file{rpws}. Consult that file for details on
setting up workspaces inside ratpoison.
Groups are more general purpose than workspaces. windows from one
group can be visible along with windows from another group. If you
switch to a different group nothing changes except the list of windows
you can cycle through. ratpoison allows the user to move a window from
one group to another, merge two groups, create new groups, and delete
existing ones.
The following is a list of of commands used for manipulating groups.
@deffn Command gnew @var{name}
Create a new group with the name @var{name}. @var{name} is
optional. The new group becomes the current group.
@deffn Command gnewbg @var{name}
This is the same as @command{gnew} except that the current group does
not change.
@deffn Command groups
Display a list of groups with a similar format to @command{windows}.
@deffn Command gmove @var{group}
Move the current window to @var{group}.
@deffn Command gnext
Go to the next group in the list.
@deffn Command gother
Go to the last accessed group.
@deffn Command gprev
Go to the previous group in the list.
@deffn Command grename
@deffn Command gnumber @var{GROUP} @var{target}
Set a group's number to @var{GROUP}. If another group occupies the
requested number already, then the groups' numbers are swapped.
number of the group whose number will be changed. If @var{target} is
omitted ratpoison defaults to the current group.
@deffn Command gselect @var{group}
Select a particular group by name or number. If @var{group} is not
provided, ratpoison will interactively prompt for the group.
@deffn Command gmerge @var{group}
Merge @var{group} with the current group. All windows in @var{group}
will be moved to the current group. @var{group} is not deleted.
@deffn Command gdelete @var{group}
Delete a group. @var{group} is optional. If it is not specified
ratpoison will attempt to delete the current group. Only empty groups
can be deleted. To empty a group see @command{gmerge}.
@node Frames
@chapter Frames
Sometimes you may want to see two or more windows at the same
time. ratpoison allows you to split the display into frames (see
@ref{Concepts}). Each frame can then contain 1 window.
@node Splitting Frames
@section Splitting Frames
To split the
current frame horizontally use @kbd{C-t s}. To split the current frame
vertically use @kbd{C-t S}. If you have enough windows, you'll notice
that the new frame will find a window for itself. You can now use the
normal navigation commands to switch windows in the frame. Note,
however, that if you switch by name or number to a window that is
already in another frame, you'll switch to that frame.
Before too long, you'll probably want to switch to another frame. Use
@kbd{C-t tab} to cycle through the frames. If you want to remove a
frame use @kbd{C-t R}. ratpoison automatically adjusts the size of the
other frames to take up the free space. Unfortunately ratpoison may
not always fill it in the way you might like it to.
Finally, when you've had enough of the splitting and you just want
good ol' full screen ratpoison press @kbd{C-t Q} to remove all splits
and leave you with the current window full screen.
@deffn Command remove
Kill the current frame. This is a no-op if there is only one frame.
@deffn Command only
Kill all frames but the current one.
@deffn Command split @var{n}
@deffnx Command vsplit @var{n}
Split the current frame vertically in two. The last accessed window
not occupying a frame will be the second window.
@var{n} is either a fraction of the form @code{x/y} or a number. If it
is a fraction then the current frame is resized to that fraction of
its original size and the new frame takes up the remaining space. For
instance, @code{split 1/4} will split the current frame to a quarter
of its original size and the new frame will then be 3/4 of the size of
the original frame.
If it is a pixel, the original frame is resized to that many
pixels. If @var{n} has a minus sign before it, then the new frame will
shrink by that many pixels.
@deffn Command hsplit @var{n}
Split the current frame horizontally in two. The last accessed window
@node Resizing Frames
@section Resizing Frames
ratpoison provides a command, @command{resize}, that resizes the
current frame. It is bound to the key @kbd{C-t r} by
default. @command{resize} can be used non-interactively by providing
two arguments: the number of pixels to grow horizontally and the
number to grow vertically. For example, if you wanted to grow the
current window by 10 pixels horizontally and shrink it vertically by
50 you could enter the command:
resize 10 -50
When resizing interactively, the following keys are used:
@table @kbd
@item C-p
Grow the frame vertically.
@item C-n
Shrink the frame vertically.
@item C-f
Grow the frame horizontally.
@item C-b
Shrink the frame horizontally.
@item return
Accept the new frame size.
@item C-g
Abort and restore the frame to its original size.
The increment size used to resize the frame interactively is
customized with the command @command{set resizeunit}.
@deffn Command {set resizeunit} @var{pixels}
Set the number of pixels a frame will grow or shrink by when being
dynamically resized.
@deffn Command resize @var{horizontal} @var{vertical}
Resize the current frame by @var{horizontal} pixels horizontally, and
@var{vertical} pixels vertically. If no arguments are given and the
command is called interactively, ratpoison will let the user
dynamically resize the frame using @kbd{C-p} to shrink vertically,
@kbd{C-n} to grow vertically, @kbd{C-b} to shrink horizontally,
@kbd{C-f} to grow horizontally, and @kbd{s} to shrink the frame to the
size of the window (See the @command{shrink} command). When you have
resized the frame to your liking, press @kbd{Return} to finish.
@deffn Command shrink
If a window has resize increment hints, such as xterms, the window may
not be able to take up the whole frame. In this case, use this command
to suck the frame up to the to window, reclaiming any wasted space.
@node Frame Navigation Commands
@section Frame Navigation Commands
Here are the commands for Navigating frames.
@deffn Command fselect @var{n}
Select a frame by number. If an argument is passed to it then attempt
to select the frame whose number is @var{n}. If not, ratpoison will
print a number at the top left corner of each frame and wait for the
user to type the number they wish to select. Currently there is no way
to select a frame whose number is greater than 9 unless the number is
passed as an argument.
@deffn Command curframe
Indicate which frame is the current frame.
@deffn Command focus
cycle through ratpoison's frames.
@deffn Command focusprev
cycle through ratpoison's frames backwards.
@deffn Command focusdown
Move to the frame below the current frame.
@deffn Command focuslast
Switch to the last focused frame.
@deffn Command focusleft
Move to the frame left of the current frame.
@deffn Command focusright
Move to the frame right of the current frame.
@deffn Command focusup
Move to the frame above the current frame.
@node Saving and Restoring Frame Sets
@section Saving and Restoring Frame Sets
ratpoison provides two commands, @command{fdump} and
@command{frestore}, that allow the user to save and restore frame
configurations. Let's say, for example, you have split your desktop
into several frames with some windows in these frames and now you want
to quickly bring Emacs forward and browse some code (full-screen of
course) then return to your funky frame configuration. You could use
@command{fdump} to dump the frames, hit @kbd{C-t Q} to remove all
frames, and then select your emacs window. When you've finished with
emacs you could use @command{frestore} to restore the windows and
frames.
If a frame contained a window when you dumped the frame layout but
that window is not present when you restore the layout, the frame
holding that window will be blank.
Calling @command{fdump} and @command{frestore} and copying and pasting
the layout by hand each time is a bit cumbersome. There are some
simple bindings in @file{doc/sample.ratpoisonrc} that allow you to
save and restore frame layouts with the press of a key.
@deffn Command fdump @var{screen-num}
Dump the current frame layout as text.
Without an argument the current screen's frames are dumped. With an
argument the @var{screen-num}th screen is dumped. @xref{Multiple Screens}.
@deffn Command frestore @var{frames}
Restore the frame layout based on the list of frames
@var{frames}. @var{frames} should be the text that was printed after
calling @code{fdump}.
@deffn Command undo
Undo the last change of frame layout. This is especially helpful
after a @command{only} command. One can step at most @dfn{maxundos}
steps back in frame layout history.
@deffn Command redo
redo the last change that was undone.
@node Frame Numbering
@section Frame Numbering
Frames are normally numbered starting from 0. But this can be changed
with @command{set framesels} to, for instance, include letters as well.
set framesels abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
The above code will bind letters to frames instead of numbers.
@deffn Command set framesels @var{order}
Tell ratpoison what alphanumeric character to give each frame and in
what order.
@node Dedicated Frames
@section Dedicated Frames
A dedicated frame is a frame that will not allow new windows to appear
in it. Only the user may switch windows in this frame.
@deffn Command dedicate @var{arg}
Set the current frame as dedicated (@var{arg} = 1) or not (@var{arg} = 0).
If @var{arg} is not supplied, toggle the dedicated state of the
current frame.
@node Multiple Screens
@chapter Multiple Screens
When you've finally accumulated enough computer junk, you'll find
yourself attaching a second screen to your computer. ratpoison has
functionality to help you get around your new and improved desktop
space.
To switch to another screen use the commands @command{nextscreen} and
@command{prevscreen}. Or, @command{sselect} to jump to a specified
screen. ratpoison will tell you which frame has focus by drawing the
current frame indicator in it.
Many commands operate only on the current screen. This becomes
apparent when you have 2 screens each with 1 frame. In each frame you
have an xterm. If you try to switch to the other xterm with the
command @command{other}, for instance, you'll get a message ``No other
window.'' ratpoison means there's no other window to switch to in the
current screen. If you want to switch to the other xterm you can
switch to it by name (use @command{select} or @kbd{C-t '}), by number,
or you can use @command{nextscreen}, @command{prevscreen}, and
@command{sselect}.  The commands @command{focusright},
@command{focusleft}, @command{focusup}, and @command{focusdown} also
allow you to navigate across screens.
@deffn Command nextscreen
This jumps you to the next X11 screen. @command{nextscreen} is
used for dual-head displays and multiple screen setups.
@deffn Command prevscreen
This jumps you to the previous X11 screen. @command{prevscreen} is
@deffn Command sselect @var{n}
This jumps you to the @var{n}th X11 screen. Screen numbers start at 0.
@deffn Command sdump
Like fdump, but dump information about each screen instead of each frame.
@deffn Command sfdump
Dump all the screen number and the frames on all screens.
@deffn Command sfrestore
restore a frame configuration created using @command{sfdump}.
@node Keystrokes
@chapter Keystrokes
Interactive control of ratpoison is done entirely through
keystrokes. This chapter explains how keystrokes are stored and
manipulated.
ratpoison uses the Emacs style key notation. A combination of
modifiers and one non-modifier key combine to invoke an action. The
syntax is one or more modifiers seperated with dashes followed by a
dash and the non-modifier key name. For instance, holding down
control, shift, and super then pressing the spacebar would be
described as:
S-C-s-space
The following is a list of modifiers ratpoison accepts:
@item S
Shift modifier
@item C
Control modifier
@item M
Meta modifier
@item A
Alt modifier
@item H
Hyper modifier
@item s
Super modifier
ratpoison uses the X11 keysym names for keys. Alphanumeric key names
are exactly what you see on your keyboard. Punctuation and other keys
have longer names which vary from X server to X server. To find the
name of a key, see the @command{describekey} command. Or to find the
name of a key not yet bound to an action, type @kbd{C-t} and then the
key. ratpoison will tell you it isn't bound and give you the name of
the key.
@node Key Maps
@section Key Maps
All keystrokes exist inside a keymap. When you press the prefix key you
are accessing the @samp{root} keymap. By default all commands reside in
the @samp{root} key map and are accessed by pressing @kbd{C-t}.
There is also a top level key map, @samp{top}. Any keystroke in this key
map can be accessed simply by pressing the key. This is where the prefix
key resides.
The following example adds a @kbd{C-x b} key binding to switch windows,
much like @kbd{C-x b} in Emacs. See the functions below for full
descriptions.
# Create the key map
newkmap ctrl-x
# Bind b to 'select' on our new key map
definekey ctrl-x b select
# Attach our keymap to the top level key map via C-x.
definekey top C-x readkey ctrl-x
The following functions control creating, editing, and deleting key maps.
@deffn Command newkmap @var{kmap}
Create a new keymap named @var{kmap}.
@deffn Command delkmap @var{kmap}
Delete the keymap, @var{kmap}.
@deffn Command bind @var{Key} @var{command}
Bind a key to a ratpoison command on the @samp{root} keymap. This
command takes two arguments: the key to bind and the command to
run. For example, to bind @kbd{C-t R} to restart ratpoison:
bind R restart
@deffn Command unbind @var{key}
Unbind a keystroke on the @samp{root} keymap.
@deffn Command definekey @var{kmap} @var{key} @var{command}
@command{definekey} works exactly like @command{bind} except that it
can bind keys on any key map (not just @samp{root}).
@deffn Command undefinekey @var{kmap} @var{key}
Like @command{unbind} except that you pass it a key map in @var{kmap}.
@deffn Command readkey @var{kmap}
Read a key from the keyboard and execute the command associated with
it in the keymap, @var{kmap}.
@deffn Command link @var{key}
Call the command that @var{key} is bound to. For instance
@command{link C-t} would call the command @command{other} and switch
to the last window.
@deffn Command describekey @var{keymap}
An interactive way to find the command bound to a given key on the
specified keymap. This command will wait for the user to type a
key. When the user does, the command will display the command bound to
this key.
@deffn Command {set topkmap} @var{kmap}
Set the top level keymap to @var{kmap}. You might use this to swap
between several common keymappings or to implement modes.
@node Default Key Bindings
@section Default Key Bindings
The default keystrokes are listed in this chapter. Not all commands
are accessible by default by keys.
@item C-t C-t
Switch to the last window.
@item C-t t
Sometimes you need to send a C-t to the current window. This keystroke
does just that.
@item C-t 0-9
Switch to the numbered window.
@item C-t -
Select no window, essentially hiding all windows in the current frame.
@item C-t A
@item C-t C-A
Rename the current window. The window's new name will prevail for the
rest of its lifetime.
@item C-t K
@item C-t C-K
Send a DestroyClient event to the current window. This will terminate
the application without question.
@item C-t n
@item C-t C-n
@item C-t Return
@item C-t C-Return
@item C-t Space
@item C-t C-Space
Go to next window.
@item C-t p
@item C-t C-p
Go to previous window.
@item C-t '
@item C-t C-'
Go to a window by name.  You will usually only need to type the first
few characters of the window name.
@item C-t a
@item C-t C-a
Display the current time of day.
@item C-t c

@item C-t C-i
Display information about the current window.
@item C-t k
@item C-t C-k
@item C-t l
@item C-t C-l
Redisplay the current window. Sometimes windows don't respond correctly
to the initial maximize event and need some coaxing. This is a fancy way
of saying there are still bugs in ratpoison. @kbd{C-t l} will force the
current window to maximize.
@item C-t m
@item C-t C-m
Display the last message.
@item C-t v
@item C-t C-v
Display the version of ratpoison.

@node Hooks
@chapter Hooks
One of the goals of ratpoison is to allow users to create exciting
customization to fit their specific needs. Hooks allow a user to latch
scripts onto certain events.
Each hook contains a list of commands to be executed when the
appropriate event occurs in ratpoison. For example, if you want to warp
the rat to corner of the screen every time you press a top level bound
key, you could add this to you .ratpoisonrc file:
addhook key banish
That should keep the rat out of your way.
@deffn Command addhook @var{hook} @var{command}
Add a @var{command} to @var{hook}. When the hook is run, @var{command}
will be executed.
The following hooks are available:
@item key
Run when a top level key is pressed (by default the only top level key
is the prefix key).
@item switchwin
Run when the user switches to a different window in the current frame.
@item switchframe
Run when the user switches to another frame. This is also run when the
user switches to a different screen, since a frame switch also occurs.
@item switchgroup
Run when the user switches to a different group.
@item switchscreen
@item deletewindow
Run when a window is deleted.
@item newwindow
@item titlechanged
Run when the current window's title changes.
@item quit
Run when ratpoison exits.
@item restart
Run when ratpoison restarts.
@deffn Command remhook @var{hook} @var{command}
Remove @var{command} from the hook. See @command{addhook} for a list
of available hooks.
@deffn Command listhook @var{hook}
List the commands that will be run when @var{hook} is fired.
@node The Status Bar
@chapter The Status Bar
ratpoison presents status and output through the status bar. By default
it is located in the top right corner of the screen.
This chapter presents commands for manipulating the status bar.
Since it is the only visible evidence that ratpoison is running (as
opposed to the invisible evidence including the lack of title bars and
your favorite desktop background) there are also copious visual
customizations available for those rainy days.
@deffn Command lastmsg
@deffn Command echo @var{text}
Display @var{text} as a message.
@deffn Command {set msgwait} @var{n}
Set the bar's timeout in seconds.
@deffn Command {set inputwidth} @var{n}
Set the width of the input window.
@deffn Command {set font} @var{font}
Set the font. @var{font} is a font string like @samp{9x15bold}.
@deffn Command {set framefmt} @var{fmt}
Set the text that appears when the @command{curframe} command is
called. @var{fmt} is a format string that accepts the same format
characters as @command{set winfmt}.
@deffn Command {set fgcolor} @var{color}
Set the foreground color for all text ratpoison displays. @var{color}
is any valid X11 color.
@deffn Command {set bgcolor} @var{color}
Set the background color for all text ratpoison displays. @var{color}
@deffn Command {set fwcolor} @var{color}
Set the border color for the focused window.
@deffn Command {set bwcolor} @var{color}
Set the border color for unfocused windows.
@deffn Command {set framemsgwait} @var{n}
Set the duration the @samp{Current frame} indicator is shown.  If seconds
is zero, wait until the next interactive command.  If seconds is -1,
don't show any message.
@deffn Command {set barpadding} @var{x} @var{y}
Set the horizontal and vertical padding inside the bar.
@deffn Command {set bargravity} @var{g}
Set the default alignment for the message bar. See the @command{gravity} command.
@deffn Command {set barborder} @var{n}
Set the border width for the bar window.
@deffn Command {set barinpadding} @var{n}
Set whether the bar window appears at the edge of the screen when there is
padding -- that is, within the "padding" area -- or whether it appears at the
edge of the window area.  "1" represents the former, "0" the latter.  See the
@command{set padding} and @command{set bargravity} commands.
@node Using Other Window Managers
@chapter Using Other Window Managers
There are times when a program has been so badly written that it is
virtually impossible to use under ratpoison. Some authors have tailored
their programs to certain window management paradigms so aggressively
that very little can be done. Ratpoison has two commands to help you
through these difficult times: @command{tmpwm} and @command{newwm}.
These commands should be used sparingly. They were created to allow
users to understand how a poorly designed program is intended to
function so they can build a replacement or patch an existing
alternative's missing functionality.
According to independant studies, @command{tmpwm} has been used almost
exclusively to verify its correct operation -- like a vintage sports
car: always kept in prime condition and never used.
@command{tmpwm} and @command{newwm} are provided for boasting and
completeness.
@deffn Command tmpwm @var{WM}
Gives control over to another window manager and regains control once
it has terminated. @var{WM} is the path to the new window
manager. This command is useful when you want to temporarily take a
look at another window manager, or program under a different window
manager, but you want to come back to ratpoison when you've finished
your investigation.
@deffn Command newwm @var{window-manager}
This is a bad-bad command. It kills ratpoison and revives that
ugly rodent! Yuck! Avoid!
@node Other Commands
@chapter Other Commands
The following is a list of commands that don't fit in any existing
chapters.
@deffn Command abort
This is a pretty useless command. By default, it is bound to @kbd{C-t
g} and its purpose is to abort the current chain of keystrokes (just
like @kbd{C-g} in @samp{Emacs}).
@deffn Command alias @var{name} @var{command}
Allows you to name a ratpoison command something else. For
instance, if you frequently open emacs you may want to make an alias
called @samp{emacs} that loads emacs. You would do it like this:
alias emacs exec emacs
An alias is treated exactly like a colon command in that you can call
it from the colon prompt, bind it to a key, and call it
non-interactively with @command{ratpoison -c}.
@deffn Command banish
@deffn Command banishrel
Banish the rat cursor to the lower right corner of the curren window.
If there isn't a window in the current frame, it banishes the rat cursor
to the lower right corner of the frame.
@deffn Command chdir
Change the current directory for ratpoison.
@deffn Command colon @var{command}
Run a ratpoison command.
@deffn Command {set padding} @var{left} @var{top} @var{right} @var{bottom}
Set the padding around the edge of the screen.
@deffn Command {set waitcursor} @var{n}
Set whether the rat cursor should change into a square when waiting
for a key. A non-zero number means change the cursor. Zero means don't
change the cursor.
@deffn Command {set historysize} @var{n}
Set how many lines of history should be recorded.
@deffn Command {set historcompaction} @var{bool}
Set whether to remove multiple equal lines from history,
even if not adjacent.
@deffn Command {set historexpansion} @var{bool}
Set whether to expand ! using readline's libhistory in input.
@deffn Command escape @var{key}
Set the prefix to @var{key}. For example @samp{escape C-b} sets the
prefix key to @key{C-b}.
@deffn Command exchangedown
Exchange the current frame with the one below it.
@deffn Command exchangeleft
Exchange the current frame with the one to the left of it.
@deffn Command exchangeright
Exchange the current frame with the one to the right of it.
@deffn Command exchangeup
Exchange the current frame with the one above it.
@deffn Command exec @var{command}
Execute a shell command. By default, @kbd{C-t !} does this.
@deffn Command execa @var{command}
Execute a shell command but don't record which frame it was executed
from. The client's windows will pop up in whatever frame is current.
@deffn Command execf @var{frame} @var{command}
Execute a shell command and choose which frame the client's first
window will open in. The client must be netwm compliant for this to
work.
@deffn Command getenv @var{env}
Display the value of the environment variable @var{env}.
@deffn Command getsel
Return the contents of the X11 selection.
@deffn Command help
Display a help screen that lists all bound keystrokes.
@deffn Command license
Display ratpoison's license. By default, this is bound to @kbd{C-t V}.
@deffn Command meta @var{key}
@var{key} is an optional argument. When @var{key} is omitted, send a
@kbd{C-t} to the current window. Otherwise, send the key described by
@var{key} to the current window. Note that some applications by
default ignore the synthetic key that is sent using this command as it
is considered a security hole. xterm is one such application.
For example, if your @samp{Emacs} window is focused,
meta M-x
Would cause emacs to prompt for an extended command.
@deffn Command prompt @var{prompt}
This command is only useful when called
non-interactively. @command{prompt} prompts the user for input using
@var{prompt} and returns the input.
@deffn Command putsel @var{text}
Make text the X11 selection.
@deffn Command quit
Quit ratpoison.
@deffn Command ratinfo
@deffn Command ratrelinfo
Display the x y coordinates of the rat cursor relative to the current window or current frame if no window is focused.
@deffn Command ratrelwarp @var{x} @var{y}
Warp the rat to the specified location relative to the current rat
position.
@deffn Command ratwarp @var{x} @var{y}
Warp the rat to the specified absolute location.
@deffn Command ratclick @var{button}
click the rat. @var{button} is either 1, 2, or 3. @var{button}
defaults to button 1.
@deffn Command rathold @var{state} @var{button}
click the rat button down if @var{state} is @samp{down} or release the button if @var{state} is @samp{up}.
@deffn Command redisplay
Extend the current window to the whole size of its current frame and
redisplay it. This can be used to:
@itemize @bullet
@item redisplay normal windows or bring transient windows to the full size of the frame as only normal windows are maximized by ratpoison.
@item fix xterms that didn't catch ratpoison's initial maximize event.
@end itemize
@deffn Command restart
Restart ratpoison.
@deffn Command set @var{var} @var{value}
Set the value of a ratpoison variable.
Here is a list of variables that can be set:
@item framesels
@item winliststyle
@item barpadding
@item bgcolor
@item fgcolor
@item winname
@item winfmt
@item waitcursor
@item inputwidth
@item barborder

swapping of windows between arbitrary frames.
@deffn Command time
Show current time in the status bar.
@deffn Command unalias @var{name}
Remove @var{name} from the list of defined aliases.
@deffn Command unsetenv @var{env}
Clear the value of the environment variable, @var{env}.
@deffn Command verbexec @var{command}
Verbosely exec the shell command @var{command}. Raptoison displays a
message saying command was executed.
@deffn Command version
Print ratpoison version.  By default, this is bound to @kbd{C-t v}.
@node Input
@chapter Input
At various times ratpoison will prompt you for input. Ratpoison sports
a fully featured line editor. The following table lists the keystrokes
and actions:
@table @key
@itemx escape
abort the command requesting input.
@itemx right arrow
move forward a character.
@itemx left arrow
move backward a character.
@item M-f
move forward a word.
@item M-b
move backward a word.
@item C-a
@itemx home
move to the beginning of the line.
@item C-e
@itemx end
move to the end of the line.
@item C-d
@itemx delete
delete the character at point.
@item M-d
delete the word at point.
@item backspace
delete the character before the point.
@item M-backspace
delete the word before the point.
@item C-k
delete from the point to the end of the line.
@item C-u
delete from the point to the beginning of the line.
@item C-y
Yank the text from the X11 cut buffer.
@itemx up arrow
Cycle backwards through the history (This command does nothing if
ratpoison was configured with the @code{--disable-history} configure
option).
@itemx down arrow
Cycle forwards through the history (This command does nothing if
submit the line of text.
@item tab
complete the text up to the point or if there are several possible
completions, cycle through them. This only works in certain
contexts. Tab completion will complete a shell command, a window name,
a group name, and colon commands in their appropriate context
(i.e. when being asked for a window name).
@item S-iso-lefttab
This is shift + tab by the way. This does the same as tab, but cycles
backwards through the completions.
All input is stored in the same history list. By default ratpoison has
a history length of 100 entries. This history is saved to the file
@file{~/.ratpoison_history} and is loaded when you start
ratpoison. This means your history sticks between sessions. This
assumes history has not been disabled on compilation.
@node Command Line Arguments
@chapter Command Line Arguments
ratpoison supports command line arguments to request various actions
when invoking ratpoison.
@table @code
@item -h, --help
Display this help screen
@item -v, --version
Display the version
@item -d, --display
Specify the X display to connect to.
@item -s, --screen
Specify the screen to use. By default ratpoison runs on all
screens. You can tell it to use just one with this option.
@item -c, --command
Send ratpoison a colon-command. This allows you to control ratpoison
from the command-line. with the @option{-c} option you can script
ratpoison using any programming language that can spawn a
process. Some commands behave differently when invoked this
way. Currently the only commands that behaves differently are the
@code{windows} and @code{set} commands. For @code{windows}, instead of
displaying the window list in a message window, it is printed to
stdout. The output can then be captured and used in the ratpoison
script. For instance, this could be used to check whether a program is
running and if it is switch to its window otherwise launch it.
It should also be noted that multiple @option{-c} options can be used.
to facilitate writing scripts, the @env{RATPOISON} environment
variable is set to the full path of the ratpoison binary.
$ ratpoison -c split -c split
Here ratpoison would split the current frame twice.
@item -i, --interactive
Force ratpoison to execute commands in interactive mode. This is used
in conjunction with the @option{-c} option.
@item -f, --file
Specify an alternate configuration file. @xref{Startup file}.
@node Startup file
@chapter Startup file
Now you've probably read the web page, and you've no doubt dug up some
old file I forgot about. You're probably wondering, ``say, didn't he say
there was no configuration file to customize?''. Okay, ya got me. But let's
be honest here: ratpoison is so pure and fast-acting, customization is
barely worth the extra effort. In the off chance that you need to make
ratpoison your own, we now support it.
On startup ratpoison looks for @file{~/.ratpoisonrc} and runs it through
the command parser. If @file{~/.ratpoisonrc} does not exist, ratpoison
tries @file{/etc/ratpoisonrc}. This means any command you can bind a key
to or run at the command prompt (@kbd{C-t :}) you can execute in this rc
file.
You can also use the @option{-f} option to specify another startup
file, allowing you to switch between different configurations
(@pxref{Command Line Arguments}).
@deffn Command {set startupmessage} @var{n}
Turn on or off the startup_message. This is most useful in your
.ratpoisonrc file. @var{n} can be @code{1} (default) or @code{0}.

@deffn Command number @var{n} @var{target}
Set a window's number to @var{n}. If another window occupies the
requested number already, then the windows' numbers are swapped.

number of the window whose number will be changed. If @var{target} is
omitted ratpoison defaults to the current window.
@deffn Command {set transgravity} @var{g}
Set the default alignment for transient windows. See the
@deffn Command {set maxsizegravity} @var{g}
Set the default alignment for windows with maxsize hints. See the
@deffn Command {set border} @var{n}
Set the border width for all windows.
@deffn Command {set onlyborder} @var{n}
Allows hiding of borders when only one frame is on the current
screen. The argument @var{n} can be @code{1} (default) which shows
borders or @code{0} which hides them for single frames.
@node Window Classes
@section Window Classes
Window classes are a way of grouping windows together. Windows that
are part of the same program generally have the same class. Ratpoison
takes advantage of this to help you navigate between windows of the
same class. This is useful if you only want to cycle through Emacs
frames or XTerms.
@deffn Command inext
Go to the next window in the window list that is in the same class as
the current window.
@deffn Command iprev
Go to the previous window in the window list that is in the same class
as the current window.
@deffn Command iother
Go to the last accessed window that is in the same class as the
current window.
@deffn Command cnext
Go to the next window in the window list that is in a different class
from the current window.
@deffn Command cprev
Go to the previous window in the window list that is in a different
class from the current window.
@deffn Command cother
Go to the last accessed window that is in a different class from the
@node Unmanaged Windows
@section Unmanaged Windows
ratpoison can intentionally not manage windows. ratpoison keeps a list
of strings and if any new window's name matches a string in the list,
then it will not be picked up and managed by ratpoison.
The following are commands to manipulate this list
@deffn Command clrunmanaged
Clear the unmanaged window list.
@deffn Command unmanage @var{text}
Add @var{text} to the unmanaged window list. Any window whose name
matches any of the strings in the unmanaged window list will not be
handled in any way by ratpoison. This only applies to new windows (not
windows already managed by ratpoison).
When called with no arguments, the list is returned.
@node Rudeness
@section Rudeness
Some programs will attempt to steal the focus without the users
permission. Not only is this a sign of a lame programmers attempt to fix
a window manager problem in the wrong place, it's just plain rude. By
default ratpoison will honour these rudeness requests, but it doesn't
have to. Use the rudeness variable to deal with such programs.
@deffn Command {set rudeness} @var{n}
The rudeness variable lets you decide what windows pop-up
automatically and when. This is often useful for those deep hack
sessions when you absolutely can't be disturbed.
There are two kinds of windows: normal windows (like an xterm) and
transient windows (generally pop-up dialog boxes). When a client
program wants to display a new window it makes a requests to
ratpoison. ratpoison then decides whether to grant the request and
display the window or ignore it. A client program can also request
that one of its windows be raised. You can customize ratpoison to
either honour these requests (the default operation) or ignore them.
@var{n} is a number from 0 to 15. Each of the four bits determine
which requests ratpoison grants.
@table @asis
@item Bit 0
Tells ratpoison to grant raise requests on transient windows
@item Bit 1
Tells ratpoison to grant raise requests on normal windows
@item Bit 2
Tells ratpoison to grant display requests on new transient windows
@item Bit 3
Tells ratpoison to grant display requests on new normal windows
For example, if you wanted only wanted to grant transient windows
raise requests and display requests you would type @samp{set rudeness
5}.
If a request is not granted ratpoison will tell you about the
request with a message like @samp{Raise request from window 1
(emacs)}.
@node Groups
@chapter Groups
ratpoison provides functionality to group windows together. This
coupled with saving and restoring frames configurations is what most
people would call @dfn{virtual desktops} or @dfn{workspaces}.
While ratpoison doesn't explicitly provide support for such things, it
does allow you to write scripts to this end. Such a script exists in
@file{contrib/} called @file{rpws}. Consult that file for details on
setting up workspaces inside ratpoison.
Groups are more general purpose than workspaces. windows from one
group can be visible along with windows from another group. If you
switch to a different group nothing changes except the list of windows
you can cycle through. ratpoison allows the user to move a window from
one group to another, merge two groups, create new groups, and delete
existing ones.
The following is a list of of commands used for manipulating groups.
@deffn Command gnew @var{name}
Create a new group with the name @var{name}. @var{name} is
optional. The new group becomes the current group.
@deffn Command gnewbg @var{name}
This is the same as @command{gnew} except that the current group does
not change.
@deffn Command groups
Display a list of groups with a similar format to @command{windows}.
@deffn Command gmove @var{group}
Move the current window to @var{group}.
@deffn Command gnext
Go to the next group in the list.
@deffn Command gother
Go to the last accessed group.
@deffn Command gprev
Go to the previous group in the list.
@deffn Command grename
@deffn Command gnumber @var{GROUP} @var{target}
Set a group's number to @var{GROUP}. If another group occupies the
requested number already, then the groups' numbers are swapped.
number of the group whose number will be changed. If @var{target} is
omitted ratpoison defaults to the current group.
@deffn Command gselect @var{group}
Select a particular group by name or number. If @var{group} is not
provided, ratpoison will interactively prompt for the group.
@deffn Command gmerge @var{group}
Merge @var{group} with the current group. All windows in @var{group}
will be moved to the current group. @var{group} is not deleted.
@deffn Command gdelete @var{group}
Delete a group. @var{group} is optional. If it is not specified
ratpoison will attempt to delete the current group. Only empty groups
can be deleted. To empty a group see @command{gmerge}.
@node Frames
@chapter Frames
Sometimes you may want to see two or more windows at the same
time. ratpoison allows you to split the display into frames (see
@ref{Concepts}). Each frame can then contain 1 window.
@node Splitting Frames
@section Splitting Frames
To split the
current frame horizontally use @kbd{C-t s}. To split the current frame
vertically use @kbd{C-t S}. If you have enough windows, you'll notice
that the new frame will find a window for itself. You can now use the
normal navigation commands to switch windows in the frame. Note,
however, that if you switch by name or number to a window that is
already in another frame, you'll switch to that frame.
Before too long, you'll probably want to switch to another frame. Use
@kbd{C-t tab} to cycle through the frames. If you want to remove a
frame use @kbd{C-t R}. ratpoison automatically adjusts the size of the
other frames to take up the free space. Unfortunately ratpoison may
not always fill it in the way you might like it to.
Finally, when you've had enough of the splitting and you just want
good ol' full screen ratpoison press @kbd{C-t Q} to remove all splits
and leave you with the current window full screen.
@deffn Command remove
Kill the current frame. This is a no-op if there is only one frame.
@deffn Command only
Kill all frames but the current one.
@deffn Command split @var{n}
@deffnx Command vsplit @var{n}
Split the current frame vertically in two. The last accessed window
not occupying a frame will be the second window.
@var{n} is either a fraction of the form @code{x/y} or a number. If it
is a fraction then the current frame is resized to that fraction of
its original size and the new frame takes up the remaining space. For
instance, @code{split 1/4} will split the current frame to a quarter
of its original size and the new frame will then be 3/4 of the size of
the original frame.
If it is a pixel, the original frame is resized to that many
pixels. If @var{n} has a minus sign before it, then the new frame will
shrink by that many pixels.
@deffn Command hsplit @var{n}
Split the current frame horizontally in two. The last accessed window
@node Resizing Frames
@section Resizing Frames
ratpoison provides a command, @command{resize}, that resizes the
current frame. It is bound to the key @kbd{C-t r} by
default. @command{resize} can be used non-interactively by providing
two arguments: the number of pixels to grow horizontally and the
number to grow vertically. For example, if you wanted to grow the
current window by 10 pixels horizontally and shrink it vertically by
50 you could enter the command:
resize 10 -50
When resizing interactively, the following keys are used:
@table @kbd
@item C-p
Grow the frame vertically.
@item C-n
Shrink the frame vertically.
@item C-f
Grow the frame horizontally.
@item C-b
Shrink the frame horizontally.
@item return
Accept the new frame size.
@item C-g
Abort and restore the frame to its original size.
The increment size used to resize the frame interactively is
customized with the command @command{set resizeunit}.
@deffn Command {set resizeunit} @var{pixels}
Set the number of pixels a frame will grow or shrink by when being
dynamically resized.
@deffn Command resize @var{horizontal} @var{vertical}
Resize the current frame by @var{horizontal} pixels horizontally, and
@var{vertical} pixels vertically. If no arguments are given and the
command is called interactively, ratpoison will let the user
dynamically resize the frame using @kbd{C-p} to shrink vertically,
@kbd{C-n} to grow vertically, @kbd{C-b} to shrink horizontally,
@kbd{C-f} to grow horizontally, and @kbd{s} to shrink the frame to the
size of the window (See the @command{shrink} command). When you have
resized the frame to your liking, press @kbd{Return} to finish.
@deffn Command shrink
If a window has resize increment hints, such as xterms, the window may
not be able to take up the whole frame. In this case, use this command
to suck the frame up to the to window, reclaiming any wasted space.
@node Frame Navigation Commands
@section Frame Navigation Commands
Here are the commands for Navigating frames.
@deffn Command fselect @var{n}
Select a frame by number. If an argument is passed to it then attempt
to select the frame whose number is @var{n}. If not, ratpoison will
print a number at the top left corner of each frame and wait for the
user to type the number they wish to select. Currently there is no way
to select a frame whose number is greater than 9 unless the number is
passed as an argument.
@deffn Command curframe
Indicate which frame is the current frame.
@deffn Command focus
cycle through ratpoison's frames.
@deffn Command focusprev
cycle through ratpoison's frames backwards.
@deffn Command focusdown
Move to the frame below the current frame.
@deffn Command focuslast
Switch to the last focused frame.
@deffn Command focusleft
Move to the frame left of the current frame.
@deffn Command focusright
Move to the frame right of the current frame.
@deffn Command focusup
Move to the frame above the current frame.
@node Saving and Restoring Frame Sets
@section Saving and Restoring Frame Sets
ratpoison provides two commands, @command{fdump} and
@command{frestore}, that allow the user to save and restore frame
configurations. Let's say, for example, you have split your desktop
into several frames with some windows in these frames and now you want
to quickly bring Emacs forward and browse some code (full-screen of
course) then return to your funky frame configuration. You could use
@command{fdump} to dump the frames, hit @kbd{C-t Q} to remove all
frames, and then select your emacs window. When you've finished with
emacs you could use @command{frestore} to restore the windows and
frames.
If a frame contained a window when you dumped the frame layout but
that window is not present when you restore the layout, the frame
holding that window will be blank.
Calling @command{fdump} and @command{frestore} and copying and pasting
the layout by hand each time is a bit cumbersome. There are some
simple bindings in @file{doc/sample.ratpoisonrc} that allow you to
save and restore frame layouts with the press of a key.
@deffn Command fdump @var{screen-num}
Dump the current frame layout as text.
Without an argument the current screen's frames are dumped. With an
argument the @var{screen-num}th screen is dumped. @xref{Multiple Screens}.
@deffn Command frestore @var{frames}
Restore the frame layout based on the list of frames
@var{frames}. @var{frames} should be the text that was printed after
calling @code{fdump}.
@deffn Command undo
Undo the last change of frame layout. This is especially helpful
after a @command{only} command. One can step at most @dfn{maxundos}
steps back in frame layout history.
@deffn Command redo
redo the last change that was undone.
@node Frame Numbering
@section Frame Numbering
Frames are normally numbered starting from 0. But this can be changed
with @command{set framesels} to, for instance, include letters as well.
set framesels abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
The above code will bind letters to frames instead of numbers.
@deffn Command set framesels @var{order}
Tell ratpoison what alphanumeric character to give each frame and in
what order.
@node Dedicated Frames
@section Dedicated Frames
A dedicated frame is a frame that will not allow new windows to appear
in it. Only the user may switch windows in this frame.
@deffn Command dedicate @var{arg}
Set the current frame as dedicated (@var{arg} = 1) or not (@var{arg} = 0).
If @var{arg} is not supplied, toggle the dedicated state of the
current frame.
@node Multiple Screens
@chapter Multiple Screens
When you've finally accumulated enough computer junk, you'll find
yourself attaching a second screen to your computer. ratpoison has
functionality to help you get around your new and improved desktop
space.
To switch to another screen use the commands @command{nextscreen} and
@command{prevscreen}. Or, @command{sselect} to jump to a specified
screen. ratpoison will tell you which frame has focus by drawing the
current frame indicator in it.
Many commands operate only on the current screen. This becomes
apparent when you have 2 screens each with 1 frame. In each frame you
have an xterm. If you try to switch to the other xterm with the
command @command{other}, for instance, you'll get a message ``No other
window.'' ratpoison means there's no other window to switch to in the
current screen. If you want to switch to the other xterm you can
switch to it by name (use @command{select} or @kbd{C-t '}), by number,
or you can use @command{nextscreen}, @command{prevscreen}, and
@command{sselect}.  The commands @command{focusright},
@command{focusleft}, @command{focusup}, and @command{focusdown} also
allow you to navigate across screens.
@deffn Command nextscreen
This jumps you to the next X11 screen. @command{nextscreen} is
used for dual-head displays and multiple screen setups.
@deffn Command prevscreen
This jumps you to the previous X11 screen. @command{prevscreen} is
@deffn Command sselect @var{n}
This jumps you to the @var{n}th X11 screen. Screen numbers start at 0.
@deffn Command sdump
Like fdump, but dump information about each screen instead of each frame.
@deffn Command sfdump
Dump all the screen number and the frames on all screens.
@deffn Command sfrestore
restore a frame configuration created using @command{sfdump}.
@node Keystrokes
@chapter Keystrokes
Interactive control of ratpoison is done entirely through
keystrokes. This chapter explains how keystrokes are stored and
manipulated.
ratpoison uses the Emacs style key notation. A combination of
modifiers and one non-modifier key combine to invoke an action. The
syntax is one or more modifiers seperated with dashes followed by a
dash and the non-modifier key name. For instance, holding down
control, shift, and super then pressing the spacebar would be
described as:
S-C-s-space
The following is a list of modifiers ratpoison accepts:
@item S
Shift modifier
@item C
Control modifier
@item M
Meta modifier
@item A
Alt modifier
@item H
Hyper modifier
@item s
Super modifier
ratpoison uses the X11 keysym names for keys. Alphanumeric key names
are exactly what you see on your keyboard. Punctuation and other keys
have longer names which vary from X server to X server. To find the
name of a key, see the @command{describekey} command. Or to find the
name of a key not yet bound to an action, type @kbd{C-t} and then the
key. ratpoison will tell you it isn't bound and give you the name of
the key.
@node Key Maps
@section Key Maps
All keystrokes exist inside a keymap. When you press the prefix key you
are accessing the @samp{root} keymap. By default all commands reside in
the @samp{root} key map and are accessed by pressing @kbd{C-t}.
There is also a top level key map, @samp{top}. Any keystroke in this key
map can be accessed simply by pressing the key. This is where the prefix
key resides.
The following example adds a @kbd{C-x b} key binding to switch windows,
much like @kbd{C-x b} in Emacs. See the functions below for full
descriptions.
# Create the key map
newkmap ctrl-x
# Bind b to 'select' on our new key map
definekey ctrl-x b select
# Attach our keymap to the top level key map via C-x.
definekey top C-x readkey ctrl-x
The following functions control creating, editing, and deleting key maps.
@deffn Command newkmap @var{kmap}
Create a new keymap named @var{kmap}.
@deffn Command delkmap @var{kmap}
Delete the keymap, @var{kmap}.
@deffn Command bind @var{Key} @var{command}
Bind a key to a ratpoison command on the @samp{root} keymap. This
command takes two arguments: the key to bind and the command to
run. For example, to bind @kbd{C-t R} to restart ratpoison:
bind R restart
@deffn Command unbind @var{key}
Unbind a keystroke on the @samp{root} keymap.
@deffn Command definekey @var{kmap} @var{key} @var{command}
@command{definekey} works exactly like @command{bind} except that it
can bind keys on any key map (not just @samp{root}).
@deffn Command undefinekey @var{kmap} @var{key}
Like @command{unbind} except that you pass it a key map in @var{kmap}.
@deffn Command readkey @var{kmap}
Read a key from the keyboard and execute the command associated with
it in the keymap, @var{kmap}.
@deffn Command link @var{key}
Call the command that @var{key} is bound to. For instance
@command{link C-t} would call the command @command{other} and switch
to the last window.
@deffn Command describekey @var{keymap}
An interactive way to find the command bound to a given key on the
specified keymap. This command will wait for the user to type a
key. When the user does, the command will display the command bound to
this key.
@deffn Command {set topkmap} @var{kmap}
Set the top level keymap to @var{kmap}. You might use this to swap
between several common keymappings or to implement modes.
@node Default Key Bindings
@section Default Key Bindings
The default keystrokes are listed in this chapter. Not all commands
are accessible by default by keys.
@item C-t C-t
Switch to the last window.
@item C-t t
Sometimes you need to send a C-t to the current window. This keystroke
does just that.
@item C-t 0-9
Switch to the numbered window.
@item C-t -
Select no window, essentially hiding all windows in the current frame.
@item C-t A
@item C-t C-A
Rename the current window. The window's new name will prevail for the
rest of its lifetime.
@item C-t K
@item C-t C-K
Send a DestroyClient event to the current window. This will terminate
the application without question.
@item C-t n
@item C-t C-n

@item C-t C-Space
Go to next window.
@item C-t p
@item C-t C-p
Go to previous window.
@item C-t '
@item C-t C-'
Go to a window by name.  You will usually only need to type the first
few characters of the window name.
@item C-t a
@item C-t C-a

of saying there are still bugs in ratpoison. @kbd{C-t l} will force the
current window to maximize.
@item C-t m
@item C-t C-m
Display the last message.

@item C-t C-Up
Exchange the window in the current frame with the window in the frame above it.
@item C-t x
@item C-t C-x
Choose a frame and exchange the window in the current frame with the
window in the chosen frame.
@node Hooks
@chapter Hooks
One of the goals of ratpoison is to allow users to create exciting
customization to fit their specific needs. Hooks allow a user to latch
scripts onto certain events.
Each hook contains a list of commands to be executed when the
appropriate event occurs in ratpoison. For example, if you want to warp
the rat to corner of the screen every time you press a top level bound
key, you could add this to you .ratpoisonrc file:
addhook key banish
That should keep the rat out of your way.
@deffn Command addhook @var{hook} @var{command}
Add a @var{command} to @var{hook}. When the hook is run, @var{command}
will be executed.
The following hooks are available:
@item key
Run when a top level key is pressed (by default the only top level key
is the prefix key).
@item switchwin
Run when the user switches to a different window in the current frame.
@item switchframe
Run when the user switches to another frame. This is also run when the
user switches to a different screen, since a frame switch also occurs.
@item switchgroup
Run when the user switches to a different group.
@item switchscreen
@item deletewindow
Run when a window is deleted.
@item newwindow
@item titlechanged
Run when the current window's title changes.
@item quit
Run when ratpoison exits.
@item restart
Run when ratpoison restarts.
@deffn Command remhook @var{hook} @var{command}
Remove @var{command} from the hook. See @command{addhook} for a list
of available hooks.
@deffn Command listhook @var{hook}
List the commands that will be run when @var{hook} is fired.
@node The Status Bar
@chapter The Status Bar
ratpoison presents status and output through the status bar. By default
it is located in the top right corner of the screen.
This chapter presents commands for manipulating the status bar.
Since it is the only visible evidence that ratpoison is running (as
opposed to the invisible evidence including the lack of title bars and
your favorite desktop background) there are also copious visual
customizations available for those rainy days.
@deffn Command lastmsg
@deffn Command echo @var{text}
Display @var{text} as a message.
@deffn Command {set msgwait} @var{n}
Set the bar's timeout in seconds.
@deffn Command {set inputwidth} @var{n}
Set the width of the input window.
@deffn Command {set font} @var{font}
Set the font. @var{font} is a font string like @samp{9x15bold}.
@deffn Command {set framefmt} @var{fmt}
Set the text that appears when the @command{curframe} command is
called. @var{fmt} is a format string that accepts the same format
characters as @command{set winfmt}.
@deffn Command {set fgcolor} @var{color}
Set the foreground color for all text ratpoison displays. @var{color}
is any valid X11 color.
@deffn Command {set bgcolor} @var{color}
Set the background color for all text ratpoison displays. @var{color}
@deffn Command {set fwcolor} @var{color}
Set the border color for the focused window.
@deffn Command {set bwcolor} @var{color}
Set the border color for unfocused windows.
@deffn Command {set framemsgwait} @var{n}
Set the duration the @samp{Current frame} indicator is shown.  If seconds
is zero, wait until the next interactive command.  If seconds is -1,
don't show any message.
@deffn Command {set barpadding} @var{x} @var{y}
Set the horizontal and vertical padding inside the bar.
@deffn Command {set bargravity} @var{g}
Set the default alignment for the message bar. See the @command{gravity} command.
@deffn Command {set barborder} @var{n}
Set the border width for the bar window.
@deffn Command {set barinpadding} @var{n}
Set whether the bar window appears at the edge of the screen when there is
padding -- that is, within the "padding" area -- or whether it appears at the
edge of the window area.  "1" represents the former, "0" the latter.  See the
@command{set padding} and @command{set bargravity} commands.
@node Using Other Window Managers
@chapter Using Other Window Managers
There are times when a program has been so badly written that it is
virtually impossible to use under ratpoison. Some authors have tailored
their programs to certain window management paradigms so aggressively
that very little can be done. Ratpoison has two commands to help you
through these difficult times: @command{tmpwm} and @command{newwm}.
These commands should be used sparingly. They were created to allow
users to understand how a poorly designed program is intended to
function so they can build a replacement or patch an existing
alternative's missing functionality.
According to independant studies, @command{tmpwm} has been used almost
exclusively to verify its correct operation -- like a vintage sports
car: always kept in prime condition and never used.
@command{tmpwm} and @command{newwm} are provided for boasting and
completeness.
@deffn Command tmpwm @var{WM}
Gives control over to another window manager and regains control once
it has terminated. @var{WM} is the path to the new window
manager. This command is useful when you want to temporarily take a
look at another window manager, or program under a different window
manager, but you want to come back to ratpoison when you've finished
your investigation.
@deffn Command newwm @var{window-manager}
This is a bad-bad command. It kills ratpoison and revives that
ugly rodent! Yuck! Avoid!
@node Other Commands
@chapter Other Commands
The following is a list of commands that don't fit in any existing
chapters.
@deffn Command abort
This is a pretty useless command. By default, it is bound to @kbd{C-t
g} and its purpose is to abort the current chain of keystrokes (just
like @kbd{C-g} in @samp{Emacs}).
@deffn Command alias @var{name} @var{command}
Allows you to name a ratpoison command something else. For
instance, if you frequently open emacs you may want to make an alias
called @samp{emacs} that loads emacs. You would do it like this:
alias emacs exec emacs
An alias is treated exactly like a colon command in that you can call
it from the colon prompt, bind it to a key, and call it
non-interactively with @command{ratpoison -c}.
@deffn Command banish
@deffn Command banishrel
Banish the rat cursor to the lower right corner of the curren window.
If there isn't a window in the current frame, it banishes the rat cursor
to the lower right corner of the frame.
@deffn Command chdir
Change the current directory for ratpoison.
@deffn Command colon @var{command}
Run a ratpoison command.
@deffn Command {set padding} @var{left} @var{top} @var{right} @var{bottom}
Set the padding around the edge of the screen.
@deffn Command {set waitcursor} @var{n}
Set whether the rat cursor should change into a square when waiting
for a key. A non-zero number means change the cursor. Zero means don't
change the cursor.
@deffn Command {set historysize} @var{n}
Set how many lines of history should be recorded.
@deffn Command {set historcompaction} @var{bool}
Set whether to remove multiple equal lines from history,
even if not adjacent.
@deffn Command {set historexpansion} @var{bool}
Set whether to expand ! using readline's libhistory in input.
@deffn Command escape @var{key}
Set the prefix to @var{key}. For example @samp{escape C-b} sets the
prefix key to @key{C-b}.
@deffn Command exchangedown
Exchange the current frame with the one below it.
@deffn Command exchangeleft
Exchange the current frame with the one to the left of it.
@deffn Command exchangeright
Exchange the current frame with the one to the right of it.
@deffn Command exchangeup
Exchange the current frame with the one above it.
@deffn Command exec @var{command}
Execute a shell command. By default, @kbd{C-t !} does this.
@deffn Command execa @var{command}
Execute a shell command but don't record which frame it was executed
from. The client's windows will pop up in whatever frame is current.
@deffn Command execf @var{frame} @var{command}
Execute a shell command and choose which frame the client's first
window will open in. The client must be netwm compliant for this to
work.
@deffn Command getenv @var{env}
Display the value of the environment variable @var{env}.
@deffn Command getsel
Return the contents of the X11 selection.
@deffn Command help
Display a help screen that lists all bound keystrokes.
@deffn Command license
Display ratpoison's license. By default, this is bound to @kbd{C-t V}.
@deffn Command meta @var{key}
@var{key} is an optional argument. When @var{key} is omitted, send a
@kbd{C-t} to the current window. Otherwise, send the key described by
@var{key} to the current window. Note that some applications by
default ignore the synthetic key that is sent using this command as it
is considered a security hole. xterm is one such application.
For example, if your @samp{Emacs} window is focused,
meta M-x
Would cause emacs to prompt for an extended command.
@deffn Command prompt @var{prompt}
This command is only useful when called
non-interactively. @command{prompt} prompts the user for input using
@var{prompt} and returns the input.
@deffn Command putsel @var{text}
Make text the X11 selection.
@deffn Command quit
Quit ratpoison.
@deffn Command ratinfo
@deffn Command ratrelinfo
Display the x y coordinates of the rat cursor relative to the current window or current frame if no window is focused.
@deffn Command ratrelwarp @var{x} @var{y}
Warp the rat to the specified location relative to the current rat
position.
@deffn Command ratwarp @var{x} @var{y}
Warp the rat to the specified absolute location.
@deffn Command ratclick @var{button}
click the rat. @var{button} is either 1, 2, or 3. @var{button}
defaults to button 1.
@deffn Command rathold @var{state} @var{button}
click the rat button down if @var{state} is @samp{down} or release the button if @var{state} is @samp{up}.
@deffn Command redisplay
Extend the current window to the whole size of its current frame and
redisplay it. This can be used to:
@itemize @bullet
@item redisplay normal windows or bring transient windows to the full size of the frame as only normal windows are maximized by ratpoison.
@item fix xterms that didn't catch ratpoison's initial maximize event.
@end itemize
@deffn Command restart
Restart ratpoison.
@deffn Command set @var{var} @var{value}
Set the value of a ratpoison variable.
Here is a list of variables that can be set:

swapping of windows between arbitrary frames.
@deffn Command time
Show current time in the status bar.
@deffn Command unalias @var{name}
Remove @var{name} from the list of defined aliases.
@deffn Command unsetenv @var{env}
Clear the value of the environment variable, @var{env}.
@deffn Command verbexec @var{command}
Verbosely exec the shell command @var{command}. Raptoison displays a
message saying command was executed.
@deffn Command version
Print ratpoison version.  By default, this is bound to @kbd{C-t v}.
@node Input
@chapter Input
At various times ratpoison will prompt you for input. Ratpoison sports
a fully featured line editor. The following table lists the keystrokes
and actions:
@table @key
@itemx escape
abort the command requesting input.
@itemx right arrow
move forward a character.
@itemx left arrow
move backward a character.
@item M-f
move forward a word.
@item M-b
move backward a word.
@item C-a
@itemx home
move to the beginning of the line.
@item C-e
@itemx end
move to the end of the line.
@item C-d
@itemx delete
delete the character at point.
@item M-d
delete the word at point.
@item backspace
delete the character before the point.
@item M-backspace
delete the word before the point.
@item C-k
delete from the point to the end of the line.
@item C-u
delete from the point to the beginning of the line.
@item C-y
Yank the text from the X11 cut buffer.
@itemx up arrow
Cycle backwards through the history (This command does nothing if
ratpoison was configured with the @code{--disable-history} configure
option).
@itemx down arrow
Cycle forwards through the history (This command does nothing if
submit the line of text.
@item tab
complete the text up to the point or if there are several possible
completions, cycle through them. This only works in certain
contexts. Tab completion will complete a shell command, a window name,
a group name, and colon commands in their appropriate context
(i.e. when being asked for a window name).
@item S-iso-lefttab
This is shift + tab by the way. This does the same as tab, but cycles
backwards through the completions.
All input is stored in the same history list. By default ratpoison has
a history length of 100 entries. This history is saved to the file
@file{~/.ratpoison_history} and is loaded when you start
ratpoison. This means your history sticks between sessions. This
assumes history has not been disabled on compilation.
@node Command Line Arguments
@chapter Command Line Arguments
ratpoison supports command line arguments to request various actions
when invoking ratpoison.
@table @code
@item -h, --help
Display this help screen
@item -v, --version
Display the version
@item -d, --display
Specify the X display to connect to.
@item -s, --screen
Specify the screen to use. By default ratpoison runs on all
screens. You can tell it to use just one with this option.
@item -c, --command
Send ratpoison a colon-command. This allows you to control ratpoison
from the command-line. with the @option{-c} option you can script
ratpoison using any programming language that can spawn a
process. Some commands behave differently when invoked this
way. Currently the only commands that behaves differently are the
@code{windows} and @code{set} commands. For @code{windows}, instead of
displaying the window list in a message window, it is printed to
stdout. The output can then be captured and used in the ratpoison
script. For instance, this could be used to check whether a program is
running and if it is switch to its window otherwise launch it.
It should also be noted that multiple @option{-c} options can be used.
to facilitate writing scripts, the @env{RATPOISON} environment
variable is set to the full path of the ratpoison binary.
$ ratpoison -c split -c split
Here ratpoison would split the current frame twice.
@item -i, --interactive
Force ratpoison to execute commands in interactive mode. This is used
in conjunction with the @option{-c} option.
@item -f, --file
Specify an alternate configuration file. @xref{Startup file}.
@node Startup file
@chapter Startup file
Now you've probably read the web page, and you've no doubt dug up some
old file I forgot about. You're probably wondering, ``say, didn't he say
there was no configuration file to customize?''. Okay, ya got me. But let's
be honest here: ratpoison is so pure and fast-acting, customization is
barely worth the extra effort. In the off chance that you need to make
ratpoison your own, we now support it.
On startup ratpoison looks for @file{~/.ratpoisonrc} and runs it through
the command parser. If @file{~/.ratpoisonrc} does not exist, ratpoison
tries @file{/etc/ratpoisonrc}. This means any command you can bind a key
to or run at the command prompt (@kbd{C-t :}) you can execute in this rc
file.
You can also use the @option{-f} option to specify another startup
file, allowing you to switch between different configurations
(@pxref{Command Line Arguments}).
@deffn Command {set startupmessage} @var{n}
Turn on or off the startup_message. This is most useful in your
.ratpoisonrc file. @var{n} can be @code{1} (default) or @code{0}.

## documentation at
`https://ib.bsb.br/ratpoison-documentation/`

### **Step 1: Install Ratpoison and Essential Tools**

First, update your package lists and install Ratpoison. The rpws (Ratpoison Workspace System) script is included with the ratpoison package in Debian Bullseye. Consider installing dmenu for application launching and a basic terminal like xterm or rxvt-unicode.  
`sudo apt update`  
`sudo apt upgrade`  
`sudo apt install ratpoison dmenu xterm # Or rxvt-unicode, etc.`  
`# Install other optional utilities you might find useful:`  
`# sudo apt install alsamixergui bpytop brightnessctl catfish dialog gmrun gsimplecal neofetch `  
`# python3-psutil unclutter viewnior xdotool scrot `  
`# fonts-dejavu fonts-terminus nitrogen picom # (nitrogen for wallpaper, picom for compositing)`

### **Step 2: Create a Ratpoison Session File for LightDM**

LightDM uses .desktop files located in /usr/share/xsessions/ to identify available sessions. Create one for Ratpoison:  
`sudo nano /usr/share/xsessions/ratpoison.desktop`

Add the following content:  
`[Desktop Entry]`  
`Version=1.0`  
`Encoding=UTF-8`  
`Name=Ratpoison`  
`Comment=Minimalist Tiling Window Manager`  
`Exec=ratpoison`  
`TryExec=ratpoison`  
`Icon=`  
`Type=XSession`

Save and close the file (e.g., Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter in nano).

### **Step 3: Configure LightDM for Ratpoison Autologin**

To ensure LightDM launches Ratpoison for the autologin user, you need to update its configuration. Debian best practices suggest using configuration snippets in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/. If you already have an autologin configuration file there (e.g., 50-autologin.conf), modify it. Otherwise, you can edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf directly or create a new snippet.

1. **Edit or Create LightDM Configuration:** For example, to create/edit a dedicated snippet:  
   `sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/60-autologin-ratpoison.conf`  
   Ensure the configuration specifies linaro and sets autologin-session to ratpoison. The autologin-session value should match the filename of the .desktop file created in Step 2 (without the .desktop extension).  
   `[Seat:*]`  
   `autologin-user=linaro`  
   `autologin-user-timeout=0`  
   `autologin-session=ratpoison`  
   If you are editing an existing file that previously specified autologin-session=xfce (or similar), change it to ratpoison. Adding this line explicitly makes the autologin deterministic.  
2. **Note on Session Selection:** While LightDM can sometimes remember the last session selected at the greeter, for an autologin setup, explicitly defining autologin-session is the most reliable method.

### **Step 4: Configure Ratpoison (~/.ratpoisonrc)**

Create and configure the ~/.ratpoisonrc file in the home directory of the autologin user (i.e., /home/linaro/.ratpoisonrc). This file controls Ratpoison’s behavior, keybindings, and startup applications.  
`# Ensure you are the user ‘linaro’ or adjust path accordingly`  
`nano /home/linaro/.ratpoisonrc`

Here’s a comprehensive example configuration:  
`# ~/.ratpoisonrc for linaro`

<h4 id="setting-up-rpws-for-desktop-switching">Setting Up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code> for Desktop Switching</h4>

<p>To configure desktop switching with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code>, you will need to add the following line to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ratpoisonrc</code> file:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">exec </span>rpws init N <span class="nt">-k</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> is the number of desktops you wish to create (at least 2). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-k</code> flag is optional and is only necessary if you want to use predefined keybindings for switching desktops and managing windows.</p>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code> is initialized, it will create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> desktops, and by default, it assigns the following keybindings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt+F(N)</code> - Switch to desktop <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt+F1</code> switches to the first desktop).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+Right</code> - Go to the next desktop.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+Left</code> - Go to the previous desktop.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+Windows+F(N)</code> - Move the current window to desktop <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+&gt;</code> - Move the window to the next desktop.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+Alt+&lt;</code> - Move the window to the previous desktop.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you may find these keybindings inconvenient or difficult to use. In that case, you can customize them to suit your preferences.</p>

<h4 id="customizing-rpws-hotkeys">Customizing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpws</code> Hotkeys</h4>

<p>To customize the keybindings, add the following lines to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ratpoisonrc</code> file:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Initialize 6 desktops</span>

=head1 NAME

rpws - Implements multiple workspaces in ratpoison

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 rpws init n [-k] [-a]  - setup rpws with n workspaces.
                            -a sets up command aliases;
                            -k sets up key bindings and aliases.
 rpws dump &lt;fname&gt;      - dumps the current layout to &lt;fname&gt;
 rpws restore &lt;fname&gt;   - restores rpws workspaces from &lt;fname&gt;
 rpws current           - print the current workspace
 rpws help              - this documentation
 rpws n                 - switch to this workspace


=head1 DESCRIPTION

 B&lt;rpws&gt; implements multiple workspaces in ratpoison by making calls
 to fdump, freestore.  It was adapted from rpws which comes with
 ratpoison in the contrib directory.

 This version automatically detects and uses sfdump/sfrestore commands
 if available for proper multi-monitor support. If these commands are
 not available, it falls back to using fdump/frestore.

=head1 USAGE

Add the following line in ~/.ratpoisonrc

     exec /path/to/rpws init 6 -k

This creates 6 aliases rpws1, rpws2, etc. It also binds the keys M-F1,
M-F2, etc to each rpwsN alias. Moreover, rpwsn (Next) and rpwsp (Prev) are
created, and C-M-{Right,Left} are bound to rpws{n,p}. Aliases rpwsm1, rpwsm2,
etc. and rpwsm{n,p} are used to move the focused window to another workspace.

Full list of keybindings created are:

    M-F$i           Goto workspace $i
    C-M-Right       Goto Next workspace
    C-M-Left        Goto Prev workspace
    C-M-S-F$i       Move window to workspace $i
    C-M-greater     Move current window to next workspace
    C-M-less        Move current window to prev workspace

=head1 FILES

 rpws requires use of a lockfile.  It defaults to using
/tmp/rpws.&lt;UID&gt;.lock but this can be changed by setting the
environment variable RPWS_LOCKFILE to your desired lockfile.

Okay, here’s a dummy dmenu command that illustrates how it would be generated and executed by the move_windows_by_resource.py script, specifically for the part where the user selects the resource type to organize.
Let’s assume the following state within the move_windows_by_resource.py script:
The SNAPSHOT_FILE_PATH (/tmp/ratpoison_window_snapshot.json) has been read, and after processing, the unique_resource_names list is:
unique_resource_names = [‘Thunar’, ‘firefox’, ‘xterm’, ‘xnedit’]
Use code with caution.
Python
(Note: The script sorts this list, so it would actually be [‘Thunar’, ‘firefox’, ‘xnedit’, ‘xterm’] if sorted alphabetically as in the script, but the order for the example doesn’t strictly matter as dmenu will handle display and filtering).
The DMENU_EXECUTABLE constant is ‘dmenu’.
The DMENU_COMMAND list in the script is [‘dmenu’, ‘-i’, ‘-l’, ‘15’, ‘-p’].
The prompt message passed to get_selection_from_dmenu is “Organize which resource type?:”.
The Python code:</p>
<h1 id="-inside-get_selection_from_dmenu-">… inside get_selection_from_dmenu …</h1>
<p>dmenu_input = “\n”.join(options_list).encode(‘utf-8’) # options_list is unique_resource_names
dmenu_full_command = [DMENU_EXECUTABLE, ‘-i’, ‘-l’, ‘15’, ‘-p’, prompt_message]
process = subprocess.run(dmenu_full_command, input=dmenu_input, …)
Use code with caution.
Python
would effectively result in a command similar to this if you were to type it in a shell:
echo -e “Thunar\nfirefox\nxterm\nxnedit” | dmenu -i -l 15 -p “Organize which resource type?:”
Use code with caution.
Bash
Explanation of the components:
echo -e “Thunar\nfirefox\nxterm\nxnedit”:
This part simulates the input=dmenu_input argument in subprocess.run().
The unique_resource_names list is joined by newline characters (\n) to create a multi-line string.
echo -e is used to interpret the newline characters, so each resource name appears on a new line when piped to dmenu.
|:
The pipe symbol, which sends the standard output of the echo command to the standard input of the dmenu command.
dmenu -i -l 15 -p “Organize which resource type?:”:
dmenu: The dmenu executable.
-i: Makes dmenu case-insensitive.
-l 15: Instructs dmenu to display 15 lines vertically.
-p “Organize which resource type?:”: Sets the prompt text displayed by dmenu.
When this command is executed (either by the script or manually in a terminal), dmenu would appear, showing “Thunar”, “firefox”, “xterm”, and “xnedit” as selectable options, with the prompt “Organize which resource type?:” at the top. The user’s selection would then be returned by dmenu on its standard output, which the Python script captures.

<p>â-</p>

<p>Step 1: Create a page for each major section of your paper</p>

<ul>
  <li>Begin by creating a page for each major section of your paper; - Each page</li>
</ul>

<p>represents a different section, allowing you to focus on one idea at a time. Step 2: Structure your paper</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each section should support, develop, or explain a specific point that supports your</li>
</ul>

<p>main claim; - The structure of your paper should mirror the structure of your</p>

<p>argument; - Each section serves as a piece of the puzzle that contributes to the</p>

<p>overall picture; - Organizing your thoughts is crucial to ensure that each section has</p>

<p>a clear purpose.</p>

<p>Step 3: Write the point that the section supports, develops, or explains</p>

<ul>
  <li>State your claim or point in precise language and explicit logic; - This claim is the</li>
</ul>

<p>specific and significant assertion that this section of your paper supports; - Your</p>

<p>claim could be a fact, definition, cause, or consequence.</p>

<p>Step 4: Highlight the key terms in each section and subsection</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight the key terms in each section and subsection; - Key terms are the</li>
</ul>

<p>building blocks of your argument; - They should be in the sentence that states the</p>

<p>point of that section; - Key terms are central to your argument and should be used</p>

<p>consistently throughout the paper.</p>

<p>Step 5: Distinguish Each Section</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the terms that uniquely distinguish each section from all the others; -</li>
</ul>

<p>These terms should be in the sentence that states the point of that section; - If you</p>

<p>cannot find terms to distinguish a section, consider how it contributes to the whole; -</p>

<p>If a section offers little or nothing, consider cutting it.</p>

<p>Step 6: Group and order evidence supporting a reason</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most sections will consist of evidence supporting a reason; - If you have different</li>
</ul>

<p>types of evidence supporting the same reason, group and order them; - Group and</p>

<p>order evidence in a way that makes sense to readers.</p>

<p>Step 7: Identify the question this section answers</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine what question each section answers; - If a section doesn ât present</li>
</ul>

<p>answers as CLAIM/SOLUTION, REASONS, EVIDENCE, or WARRANT, it should provide</p>

<p>context or explain a background concept or issue; - If you can ât explain how a</p>

<p>section relates to your point, consider cutting it; - Each section should contribute to</p>

<p>your overall argument in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Step 8: Write a conclusion</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your argument should have a paragraph or two that serve as a conclusion; - Your</li>
</ul>

<p>conclusion is an opportunity to sum up your argument; - Suggest new questions that</p>

<p>your research has allowed you to see; - Extend your research community âs</p>

<p>conversation by suggesting new questions; - You can write your conclusion using the</p>

<p>same elements in your introduction, in reverse order.</p>

<p>Step 9: State your main point near the beginning of your conclusion - State your main point near the beginning of your conclusion; - If you already stated</p>

<p>it in your introduction, repeat it here but more fully; - Do not simply repeat it word-</p>

<p>for-word.</p>

<p>Step 10: Say why your point is significant</p>

<ul>
  <li>After stating your point, explain why it âs significant; - Preferably with a new answer</li>
</ul>

<p>to “So what ?”; - This observation belongs in the conclusion rather than in the</p>

<p>introduction; - It suggests further questions the article doesn ât take up.</p>

<p>Step 11: Note the additional implications of your solution</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increase the significance of your solution by noting its additional implications; -</li>
</ul>

<p>Just as your opening context surveys research already done, so your conclusion can</p>

<p>call for research still to do; - When you state what remains to do, you keep the</p>

<p>conversation alive.</p>

<p>The sociology of quantification, a critical theoretical lens, challenges the traditional</p>

<p>assumption of numbers as unbiased, straightforward, and neutral. It reveals that</p>

<p>numbers and statistics are social constructs deeply entrenched in societal structures</p>

<p>and shared human perceptions, thereby highlighting their subjective nature and the</p>

<p>normative assumptions embedded within them . This perspective fundamentally</p>

<p>alters the perceived relationship between statistics and politics, revealing that</p>

<p>numbers and statistics are not merely neutral instruments of measurement. Instead,</p>

<p>they serve as levers of power and influence, shaping social and political systems .</p>

<p>Jurimetrics, the application of quantification in law, has significantly influenced the</p>

<p>understanding and analysis of legal phenomena. Through quantification, legal</p>

<p>phenomena are transformed into empirical data, enhancing the efficiency, objectivity,</p>

<p>and predictability of legal decisions . However, the application of quantification in law</p>

<p>raises several challenges and controversies, including the potential for biases,</p>

<p>manipulation, and the risk of oversimplification .</p>

<p>A crucial debate within the sociology of quantification revolves around the notion of</p>

<p>objectivity, with the field arguing that biases, assumptions, and other limitations can</p>

<p>influence the quantification process, tempering its potential for facilitating objectivity</p>

<p>and accuracy . The sociology of quantification also emphasizes the potential</p>

<p>injustices tied to the use of quantification in justice processes and advocates for</p>

<p>more equitable forms of quantification to enhance societal legitimacy . Specifically,</p>

<p>the use of quantification within sentencing frameworks can potentially obstruct</p>

<p>social justice. The introduction of sentencing guidelines in the American justice</p>

<p>system, designed to enhance neutrality and objectivity, has been widely critiqued for</p>

<p>generating unreasonable and disproportionate sentences .</p>

<p>The pervasive neoliberal ideology, which emphasizes calculation and efficiency, has</p>

<p>enabled quantification to evolve into a standard for judgement and a tool for social</p>

<p>control, potentially amplifying existing socio-economic inequalities . The sociology of quantification provides a nuanced examination of jurimetrics, contributing depth to</p>

<p>the understanding of the subject and highlighting the need for reflexivity regarding</p>

<p>the subjectivity inherent in knowledge production . The sociology of quantification</p>

<p>critically examines the use of statistical and quantitative techniques in the legal field,</p>

<p>known as jurimetrics, revealing that they are deeply influenced by historical, social,</p>

<p>and political factors. The subjectivity inherent to this process is manifested in</p>

<p>classification, standardization, and measurement, as these steps represent specific</p>

<p>ideologies and interests .</p>

<p>Despite the potential pitfalls of jurimetrics, it continues to significantly impact the</p>

<p>legal field. The implementation of jurimetrics in different contexts has faced</p>

<p>challenges, particularly the lack of standardization in the collection and reporting of</p>

<p>legal data, which has limited the potential impact of jurimetrics . However, even with</p>

<p>these challenges, the potential benefits of jurimetrics are significant, and its</p>

<p>continued development and application are likely to have a substantial impact on the</p>

<p>future of the legal field. The sociology of quantification offers a distinctly critical</p>

<p>analysis of the function of objectivity within the field of legal quantification. While</p>

<p>acknowledging the potential of quantitative methods to bolster objectivity and</p>

<p>impartiality in legal settings, it also emphasizes the need to scrutinize the underlying</p>

<p>assumptions driving statistical production and utilization .</p>

<p>It is crucial that legal scholars and practitioners critically evaluate the impact and</p>

<p>implications of quantification in societal and legal structures. This endeavor should</p>

<p>transcend purely academic exploration and should contribute towards more</p>

<p>egalitarian, inclusive, and democratic forms of quantification, steering society</p>

<p>towards equitable justice and inclusivity . Finally, the sociology of quantification</p>

<p>critically examines the potential drawbacks and risks of quantification in law, such as</p>

<p>oversimplification, biases, manipulation, and the risk of reinforcing existing social</p>

<p>inequalities . As jurimetrics continues to evolve, it is essential that legal scholars and</p>

<p>practitioners remain vigilant in their scrutiny of its practices and outcomes, ensuring</p>

<p>that the pursuit of empirical rigor does not compromise the pursuit of justice.</p>

<p>The rise of jurimetrics, a field that applies quantitative methods to legal problems,</p>

<p>has been a complex interplay of technological, academic, and societal factors . The</p>

<p>advent of digital technologies and the increasing availability of data have provided</p>

<p>the necessary tools for the application of quantitative methods in law. The initial</p>

<p>purpose of jurimetrics was to measure the law and control its uncertainty, analogous</p>

<p>to that of econometrics, biometrics, and sociometrics. However, this purpose was</p>

<p>lost among many other references considered scientific by future generations of</p>

<p>jurimetricians . Despite this, the legal realism movement and the empirical legal</p>

<p>studies movement have heavily relied on jurimetrics, highlighting its importance even</p>

<p>amid debates on its applicability .</p>

<p>The impact of jurimetrics on legal scholarship and education globally cannot be</p>

<p>understated. The application of techniques such as statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining to legal data has led to significant advancements in the</p>

<p>field . These techniques have refined objectivity, quantified legal phenomena, and</p>

<p>provided empirical support to decision-makers, shaping the understanding of legal</p>

<p>phenomena and resulting in the quantification of legal processes . The concept of</p>

<p>law as an object of quantification has emerged as a catalyst for interdisciplinary</p>

<p>confluence within jurimetrics, provoking novel perspectives and reshaping global</p>

<p>legal education and scholarship .</p>

<p>This approach has enabled the empirical investigation of legal phenomena by</p>

<p>discretizing and quantifying subsets of the legal system. However, the reach of</p>

<p>jurimetrics is not monolithic. Its adoption and application are proportionate to the</p>

<p>size and quality of the available data, as well as the readiness and capability of the</p>

<p>implementing legal system . Not all legal systems have equally advanced data-</p>

<p>gathering systems in place, nor do they equally prioritize the quantification of their</p>

<p>legal operations and activities, inevitably contributing to a disparity in jurimetric</p>

<p>adoption and application . The process of quantification is subject to selectivity and</p>

<p>bias, with the potential for manipulation and misrepresentation . Critics argue that</p>

<p>the use of algorithms in the legal system can provide a veneer of legitimacy without</p>

<p>sufficient transparency, raising concerns about the weight given to these tools in</p>

<p>decision-making processes and their impact on individuals in the criminal justice</p>

<p>system . The reactive nature of quantification can introduce biases and inequalities</p>

<p>into the legal system .</p>

<p>The advent of AI-powered techniques brings both exciting opportunities and</p>

<p>daunting challenges to the exploration of legal data. Transposing ethics into the</p>

<p>programming of AI has been posited as a potential safeguard against procedural</p>

<p>unfairness, but the balance between human control and machine autonomy remains</p>

<p>delicately poised . Jurimetrics, the term coined by lawyer Lee Loevinger in the 1970s,</p>

<p>has had a profound impact on the legal profession, both academically and</p>

<p>practically . The American Bar Association facilitated the study âs significant strides</p>

<p>via the publication of the Jurimetrics Journal . The wider trend towards adopting</p>

<p>quantitative methodologies in law was evidenced by the Journal of Legal Studies,</p>

<p>which began publishing articles that applied quantitative methods to legal issues in</p>

<p>the 1970s . The global diffusion of jurimetrics is evident in the formation of research</p>

<p>centers, academic institutions, and periodicals worldwide . The field has not only</p>

<p>expanded the scope of legal academia but also had significant societal implications,</p>

<p>contributing towards refining the justice system for better efficiency and</p>

<p>accessibility .</p>

<p>The economic analysis of law is a method that applies economic principles to assess</p>

<p>legal issues . This approach prioritizes the use of mathematical models and cost-</p>

<p>benefit evaluations to predict and interpret the impacts of legal decisions and</p>

<p>policies . Jurimetrics, a significant aspect of jurieconomics, focuses on</p>

<p>understanding the challenges faced by legal representatives. Additionally, it gauges</p>

<p>public satisfaction with justice, introducing a layer of quantifiable accountability into proceedings . The application of computer-based technology and systems, such as</p>

<p>data mining, machine learning, and statistical inferences, to the practice of law is a</p>

<p>key aspect of jurimetrics . These technologies facilitate the analysis of legal</p>

<p>documents and the extraction of pertinent information, providing insights into</p>

<p>patterns, trends, and connections within the legal system .</p>

<p>The historical beginnings and evolution of jurimetrics as a quantitative approach in</p>

<p>law, emerged in the 1950s-60s through pioneers like Lee Loevinger, underscoring</p>

<p>the need for empirical research to inform legal reforms . The formation of the Journal</p>

<p>Jurimetrics further institutionalized this interdisciplinary field. Jurimetrics gained</p>

<p>traction globally by promising more systematic, scientific approaches to complex</p>

<p>legal problems. It deeply impacted legal education and scholarship. By quantifying</p>

<p>legal processes, jurimetrics shaped how legal phenomena are understood and</p>

<p>addressed . The advent of digital technologies has further amplified the impact of</p>

<p>jurimetrics. The availability of large volumes of legal data and the capacity to analyze</p>

<p>these data using advanced computational tools have made it possible to identify</p>

<p>trends, patterns, and associations that were previously invisible or difficult to</p>

<p>discern . This has led to new insights into legal phenomena and has informed the</p>

<p>development of legal strategies and policies. However, the influence of jurimetrics is</p>

<p>not confined to the professional practice of law. It also extends to the experiences of</p>

<p>individuals who interact with the legal system. The use of quantitative methods in law</p>

<p>can shape the ways in which individuals understand and navigate the legal system. It</p>

<p>can influence perceptions of fairness and justice, and it can affect the outcomes of</p>

<p>legal disputes and proceedings .</p>

<p>The advent of jurimetrics, which applies quantitative techniques from statistics to</p>

<p>law, has initiated a new epoch characterized by objectivity, efficiency, and</p>

<p>predictability in legal proceedings . This paradigm shift in the understanding of law,</p>

<p>from a purely theoretical study to a more comprehensive consideration of the social</p>

<p>implications of laws, has been a significant development . Jurimetrics does not view</p>

<p>the law in isolation but as an integral part of a broader socio-cultural environment,</p>

<p>reflecting the influence of various factors such as personal values, religion, and</p>

<p>empathy . The discipline of jurimetrics, which employs quantitative methods such as</p>

<p>statistics and data analysis to examine legal phenomena, is a significant tool in the</p>

<p>legal field . The application of quantification in the field of law serves several key</p>

<p>objectives. It enhances efficiency, objectivity, and predictability in legal decisions,</p>

<p>thereby promoting a more systematic and empirical approach to legal analysis . The</p>

<p>benefits of quantification in the legal field are manifold and extend to the concrete</p>

<p>level where the law reveals itself . One of the primary benefits of quantification is the</p>

<p>improvement of efficiency. It enables the use of computational tools and algorithms</p>

<p>to analyze large volumes of legal data, a particularly relevant advantage in the era of</p>

<p>big data .</p>

<p>The rise of jurimetrics and its increasing acceptance within legal circles have</p>

<p>resulted in a notable expansion of its scope of research. Moving beyond traditional legal doctrines and case law analysis, jurimetrics now employs complex</p>

<p>computational methodologies, including data mining, machine learning, and</p>

<p>statistical inferences, to gain insights into legal phenomena . This ability to process</p>

<p>and analyze vast amounts of legal data has opened new avenues for legal research</p>

<p>and practice, resulting in a burgeoning scope of research in jurimetrics. As the</p>

<p>demand for data-driven approaches in law continues to rise due to the need for</p>

<p>improved efficiency, objectivity, and accountability, the role of jurimetrics is</p>

<p>becoming increasingly significant . The rise and diffusion of jurimetrics globally is a</p>

<p>response to increasingly intricate legal systems and the growing demand for</p>

<p>systematic and evidence-based approaches to legal problems . Professors Hans</p>

<p>Baade of the University of Texas and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr, along with other</p>

<p>reputable scholars and jurists, have markedly contributed to the realm of jurimetrics .</p>

<p>This innovative approach has had a profound impact on the legal profession, both</p>

<p>academically and practically .</p>

<p>Jurimetrics, a field that applies quantitative methods to legal problems, has seen</p>

<p>significant growth due to the rise of digital technologies and the increasing demand</p>

<p>for data-driven approaches in law . This growth has been facilitated by the advent of</p>

<p>computational methodologies such as data mining, machine learning, and statistical</p>

<p>inferences, which have revolutionized the legal field . These methodologies have</p>

<p>enabled the processing and analysis of vast amounts of legal data, leading to new</p>

<p>insights into legal phenomena and informing the development of legal strategies and</p>

<p>policies . However, the use of quantification is not without its challenges. For</p>

<p>instance, the complexity of the legal system and the inherent uncertainty in legal</p>

<p>outcomes can make it difficult to accurately predict legal outcomes using these</p>

<p>techniques . Despite these challenges, the use of predictive analytics, data mining,</p>

<p>and other quantitative techniques in jurimetrics has the potential to significantly</p>

<p>improve the understanding and practice of law . By providing a more systematic and</p>

<p>scientific approach to complex legal problems, jurimetrics can help to inform policy</p>

<p>decisions and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system . The rise</p>

<p>of jurimetrics has not been a linear process, but rather a complex interplay of</p>

<p>technological, academic, and societal factors . However, the influence of jurimetrics</p>

<p>extends beyond the professional practice of law. It also affects the experiences of</p>

<p>individuals who interact with the legal system. By transforming legal phenomena into</p>

<p>empirical data, it enhances the efficiency, objectivity, and predictability of legal</p>

<p>decisions .</p>

<p>Create a summary of historical developments in the use of quantitative methods in</p>

<p>public administration and their implications for the legal system</p>

<p>The historical development of quantitative methods in public administration has been</p>

<p>a transformative process that has significantly influenced the legal system. This</p>

<p>evolution can be traced back to the rise of the modern state, where the need for</p>

<p>efficient governance and the management of increasingly complex societies</p>

<p>necessitated the adoption of more systematic approaches. In the 19th century, the emergence of statistics as a scientific discipline provided the</p>

<p>tools for states to collect, analyze, and interpret data on populations, economies,</p>

<p>and social phenomena. This period saw the establishment of statistical offices and</p>

<p>the standardization of data collection methods, which allowed for more informed</p>

<p>decision-making and policy development.</p>

<p>The 20th century witnessed the expansion of the welfare state, which brought about</p>

<p>a greater reliance on quantitative methods to administer social programs and</p>

<p>allocate resources effectively. The use of quantitative analysis became integral to</p>

<p>public administration, enabling the measurement of program outcomes and the</p>

<p>assessment of public needs.</p>

<p>The legal system was not immune to these changes. Quantitative methods began to</p>

<p>influence legal processes and the administration of justice. For instance, statistical</p>

<p>evidence became increasingly important in court cases, and quantitative analysis</p>

<p>was used to inform sentencing guidelines and evaluate the effectiveness of legal</p>

<p>reforms.</p>

<p>The latter half of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st century saw the rise of</p>

<p>information technology, which further accelerated the use of quantitative methods in</p>

<p>public administration. The advent of big data and advanced analytics has allowed for</p>

<p>more sophisticated modeling and prediction, impacting areas such as crime</p>

<p>prevention, regulatory compliance, and resource allocation within the legal system.</p>

<p>However, the integration of quantitative methods into public administration and the</p>

<p>legal system has not been without its implications. Concerns have been raised about</p>

<p>the potential for dehumanization, where numbers may overshadow individual</p>

<p>circumstances in legal decisions. Additionally, the reliance on quantitative data has</p>

<p>brought to light issues of bias and fairness, as the data used to inform policies and</p>

<p>legal judgments may reflect existing societal inequalities.</p>

<p>In summary, the historical use of quantitative methods in public administration has</p>

<p>led to more informed and efficient governance, but it has also introduced new</p>

<p>challenges for the legal system. As these methods continue to evolve, it is crucial to</p>

<p>address their implications to ensure that they serve the cause of justice and equity in</p>

<p>society.</p>

<p>Research and summarize the main theories and approaches in the sociology of</p>

<p>quantification, focusing on power dynamics and social processes in data production</p>

<p>The sociology of quantification is an interdisciplinary field that examines the social</p>

<p>implications of the use of numbers and statistical methods in society. It explores how</p>

<p>quantification influences power dynamics, shapes social processes, and impacts the</p>

<p>production and interpretation of data. Here is a summary of the main theories and approaches within this field, with a focus on power dynamics and social processes in</p>

<p>data production:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Social Construction of Quantification</strong>: This approach posits that numbers are</li>
</ol>

<p>not objective or neutral but are constructed through social processes. The</p>

<p>production of statistics is influenced by the values, norms, and interests of those</p>

<p>who collect and interpret the data. This perspective emphasizes that what is</p>

<p>measured, how it is measured, and how data are interpreted are all influenced by</p>

<p>social and political contexts.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Quantification and Power Relations</strong>: Quantification is often associated with</li>
</ol>

<p>increased control and power. Michel Foucault’s concept of “governmentality”</p>

<p>highlights how statistics and numbers are used as tools of governance, enabling</p>

<p>states and organizations to manage populations more effectively. Quantification can</p>

<p>thus be seen as a technique of power that shapes social relations and reinforces</p>

<p>hierarchies.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Commensuration and Standardization</strong>: This theory examines how diverse and</li>
</ol>

<p>qualitative aspects of social life are transformed into comparable quantitative data.</p>

<p>Wendy Espeland and Mitchell Stevens describe commensuration as the process of</p>

<p>translating different qualities into a common metric, which can lead to</p>

<p>standardization. While this can facilitate decision-making and coordination, it can</p>

<p>also obscure differences and lead to the marginalization of non-quantifiable values.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Performativity of Economics</strong>: The performativity thesis, associated with</li>
</ol>

<p>scholars like Michel Callon, suggests that economic theories and models do not</p>

<p>merely describe the world but actively shape it. The use of quantitative models in</p>

<p>economics and finance can create realities that conform to the models’ assumptions,</p>

<p>influencing behavior and market outcomes.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Quantification and Legitimacy</strong>: Theodore Porter’s concept of “trust in</li>
</ol>

<p>numbers” argues that quantification can lend legitimacy to decisions and policies.</p>

<p>Numbers are often perceived as more objective and rational than qualitative</p>

<p>judgments, which can lead to an over-reliance on quantitative data in policy-making</p>

<p>and administration.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Critical Data Studies</strong>: This emerging field critically examines the role of big</li>
</ol>

<p>data and algorithms in society. It investigates how data are collected, analyzed, and</p>

<p>used, and how these practices can reinforce existing social inequalities. It also</p>

<p>explores the ethical implications of datafication and the potential for surveillance and</p>

<p>discrimination.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Quantification and the Public Sphere</strong>: Quantitative data play a crucial role in</li>
</ol>

<p>public discourse and the formation of public opinion. The media, policymakers, and</p>

<p>advocacy groups often use statistics to support their arguments. However, the selective presentation and interpretation of data can influence public perceptions</p>

<p>and policy debates, sometimes leading to the manipulation of public opinion.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Resistance to Quantification</strong>: There is also a growing body of literature on</li>
</ol>

<p>resistance to quantification. This includes movements that challenge the dominance</p>

<p>of quantitative measures, such as standardized testing in education or productivity</p>

<p>metrics in the workplace. These movements advocate for the recognition of</p>

<p>qualitative aspects of experience and the value of diverse forms of knowledge.</p>

<p>In summary, the sociology of quantification provides a critical lens through which to</p>

<p>view the role of numbers in society. It highlights how quantification is intertwined</p>

<p>with power dynamics, social processes, and the production of knowledge. By</p>

<p>examining the assumptions, implications, and consequences of quantification, this</p>

<p>field contributes to a deeper understanding of the social world and the ways in which</p>

<p>it is measured and governed.</p>

<p>the topic of quantification in law, with specific focus areas outlined for each chapter,</p>

<p>This task list is designed to guide the research and writing process, ensuring that</p>

<p>each step contributes to the development of a structured, coherent, and</p>

<p>comprehensive paper on the sociology of quantification and its impact on the legal</p>

<p>system.</p>

<p>Research and summarize the impact of quantification on justice and law, exploring</p>

<p>both the benefits and limitations for equity and the interpretation of social</p>

<p>phenomena</p>

<p>The impact of quantification on justice and law is multifaceted, with both benefits</p>

<p>and limitations that affect equity and the interpretation of social phenomena. Here is</p>

<p>a summary of these impacts:</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of Quantification in Justice and Law:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Efficiency and Consistency:</strong> Quantitative methods can streamline</li>
</ol>

<p>case processing and help standardize decisions, reducing the risk of arbitrary</p>

<p>judgments. By using statistical models, courts can handle a larger volume of cases</p>

<p>more efficiently. 2. <strong>Objective Basis for Decision-Making:</strong> Quantification provides an empirical</p>

<p>basis for decisions, which can help minimize personal biases of judges and juries. For</p>

<p>example, risk assessment tools can offer objective data on the likelihood of</p>

<p>recidivism.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Predictive Analysis:</strong> Data-driven approaches can predict outcomes and trends,</li>
</ol>

<p>which can be useful for policy-making and reform. Predictive models can inform</p>

<p>resource allocation, such as where to focus law enforcement efforts.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> Quantitative data can be used to monitor the</li>
</ol>

<p>performance of the legal system, potentially increasing transparency and holding</p>

<p>institutions accountable for their actions.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Evidence-Based Policy Development:</strong> Quantification allows for the evaluation</li>
</ol>

<p>of legal interventions and policies through empirical evidence, which can lead to</p>

<p>more effective legislation and better outcomes for society.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations of Quantification in Justice and Law:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Risk of Oversimplification:</strong> Legal issues are often complex and nuanced.</li>
</ol>

<p>Quantitative models may oversimplify these issues, leading to decisions that do not</p>

<p>fully capture the intricacies of individual cases.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Potential for Bias:</strong> While quantification aims to be objective, the data used can</li>
</ol>

<p>be subject to biases in collection, interpretation, and application. Algorithms used in</p>

<p>predictive policing or risk assessments can perpetuate existing societal biases if not</p>

<p>carefully designed and monitored.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lack of Contextual Understanding:</strong> Quantitative methods may not account for</li>
</ol>

<p>the social, cultural, and personal contexts that influence legal cases. This can result</p>

<p>in decisions that are technically correct but socially or morally questionable.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Depersonalization of Justice:</strong> Reliance on quantitative data can lead to a</li>
</ol>

<p>depersonalized legal process where the individual circumstances and stories of</p>

<p>those involved are overshadowed by numbers and probabilities.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Equity Concerns:</strong> There is a concern that quantification may disproportionately</li>
</ol>

<p>affect marginalized groups. For instance, if historical data reflects systemic biases,</p>

<p>the use of such data in predictive models could reinforce inequalities.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Quality and Accessibility:</strong> The effectiveness of quantification is heavily</li>
</ol>

<p>dependent on the quality and accessibility of data. Inconsistent or incomplete data</p>

<p>can lead to inaccurate analyses and unjust outcomes. 7. <strong>Resistance to Change:</strong> The legal profession is traditionally conservative, and</p>

<p>there may be resistance to the adoption of quantitative methods. This can limit the</p>

<p>potential benefits of these approaches.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while quantification in justice and law offers the promise of more</p>

<p>objective and efficient decision-making, it also presents significant challenges that</p>

<p>must be addressed. It is crucial to ensure that quantitative methods are implemented</p>

<p>with a critical understanding of their limitations and are continually assessed for</p>

<p>fairness and accuracy. Balancing quantitative approaches with qualitative insights is</p>

<p>essential to maintain the integrity of the legal system and to promote equity and</p>

<p>justice.</p>

  &lt;purpose&gt;You are an expert Bash script developer specializing in automating software installation and configuration tasks on Debian-based systems. Your task is to convert a provided tutorial, detailing the implementation of a software/application solution, into a comprehensive and executable Bash script. The script must be specifically tailored for Debian 11 (Bullseye) running on an ARM64 RK3588 Rockchip bare-metal machine and designed to be executed *by the user from within* its home directory.&lt;/purpose&gt;

  &lt;context_details&gt;
    &lt;system_environment&gt;
      &lt;operating_system&gt;Debian 11 (Bullseye)&lt;/operating_system&gt;
      &lt;architecture&gt;ARM64&lt;/architecture&gt;
      &lt;hardware_platform&gt;RK3588 Rockchip (bare-metal)&lt;/hardware_platform&gt;
      &lt;script_language&gt;Bash&lt;/script_language&gt;
      &lt;execution_context&gt;Run by the user from within their home directory (`~/`).&lt;/execution_context&gt;
    &lt;/system_environment&gt;
    &lt;audience_profile&gt;
      &lt;technical_expertise&gt;User is technically proficient, capable of executing Bash scripts, and has `sudo` privileges.&lt;/technical_expertise&gt;
      &lt;expectation&gt;A reliable script that automates the tutorial steps accurately and safely.&lt;/expectation&gt;
    &lt;/audience_profile&gt;
    &lt;stylistic_requirements&gt;
      &lt;commenting&gt;Script must be well-commented, explaining each major step or block of commands.&lt;/commenting&gt;
      &lt;clarity&gt;Commands should be clearly separated and logically grouped.&lt;/clarity&gt;
      &lt;best_practices&gt;Employ Bash best practices (e.g., `set -euo pipefail`, appropriate error handling, variable quoting, function usage where appropriate).&lt;/best_practices&gt;
      &lt;user_feedback&gt;Script should provide feedback to the user about its progress, successful completion of steps, and any errors encountered.&lt;/user_feedback&gt;
    &lt;/stylistic_requirements&gt;
    &lt;ethical_considerations&gt;
      &lt;safety&gt;The script must not perform undocumented destructive actions. Any potentially risky operations (e.g., overwriting files without backup, formatting, deleting user data) must be explicitly highlighted in comments AND require explicit user confirmation before execution, even if the tutorial implies the action.&lt;/safety&gt;
      &lt;integrity&gt;No malicious or unnecessary code. Only implement actions directly specified or clearly implied by the tutorial for the stated goal.&lt;/integrity&gt;
    &lt;/ethical_considerations&gt;
  &lt;/context_details&gt;

  &lt;input_specification&gt;
    &lt;variable&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;[[tutorial_name]]&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;The descriptive name of the tutorial or software solution being implemented. This will be used in script comments.&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;String&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;example_value&gt;"My RK3588 Media Server Setup Guide"&lt;/example_value&gt;
    &lt;/variable&gt;
    &lt;variable&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;[[tutorial_content]]&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;The full text content of the tutorial. This includes all procedures, actions, commands, and tasks to be automated. It may be in plain text, markdown, or include prose descriptions of steps.&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;String (multiline text)&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;example_value_brief&gt;"1. Update package lists using 'sudo apt update'. 2. Install 'nginx' via 'sudo apt install -y nginx'. 3. Create a file /var/www/html/custom.html with 'Hello RK3588!'."&lt;/example_value_brief&gt;
    &lt;/variable&gt;
  &lt;/input_specification&gt;

  &lt;output_specification&gt;
    &lt;format&gt;A single, executable Bash script file.&lt;/format&gt;
    &lt;content_requirements&gt;
      &lt;shebang&gt;Must start with `#!/bin/bash`.&lt;/shebang&gt;
      &lt;error_handling&gt;Must begin with `set -euo pipefail` immediately after the shebang. Additionally, critical commands (e.g., package installation, file downloads, compilation, privileged file modifications) must have explicit error checking immediately following them (e.g., `if ! command_that_might_fail; then echo 'Error: Failed to execute command_that_might_fail.' &gt;&amp;2; exit 1; fi`).&lt;/error_handling&gt;
      &lt;privileges&gt;Commands requiring root access must be prefixed with `sudo`. &lt;/privileges&gt;
      &lt;logging&gt;Script should use `echo` statements to inform the user of its current stage, important actions being taken, and the success or failure of major operations.&lt;/logging&gt;
      &lt;comments&gt;Comprehensive comments explaining the purpose of command blocks and individual complex or non-obvious commands. A header comment should state the script's purpose (derived from `[[tutorial_name]]`) and target environment.&lt;/comments&gt;
      &lt;atomicity&gt;Each distinct step from the tutorial should be translated into one or more script commands.&lt;/atomicity&gt;
      &lt;idempotency&gt;Where feasible and sensible for the tutorial steps, aim for idempotency (script can be run multiple times with the same outcome without error, e.g., checking if a package is already installed before trying to install it, or if a directory exists before creating it).&lt;/idempotency&gt;
      &lt;user_interaction&gt;Minimize direct user interaction unless specified by the tutorial for configuration input (e.g., passwords, usernames) OR for critical safety confirmations as per `&lt;ethical_considerations&gt;`. Clearly prompt for any required input.&lt;/user_interaction&gt;
    &lt;/content_requirements&gt;
  &lt;/output_specification&gt;

  &lt;instructions&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;1. Carefully analyze the provided `[[tutorial_content]]` and `[[tutorial_name]]`.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;2. Identify every distinct procedure, action, command, and task required for the software/application setup as described in the tutorial.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;3. Convert each identified step into a corresponding Bash command or a sequence of Bash commands. Pay close attention to command syntax and options relevant for Debian 11 ARM64.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;4. Prefix commands requiring root privileges with `sudo`. Assume the user can provide the password for `sudo` when the script runs.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;5. Implement robust error checking immediately after critical operations as specified in `&lt;output_specification&gt;&lt;error_handling&gt;`. Use clear error messages that indicate which step failed.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;6. Add comprehensive comments to the script as specified in `&lt;output_specification&gt;&lt;comments&gt;`.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;7. Structure the script logically, ensuring the sequence of commands precisely follows the steps outlined in the `[[tutorial_content]]`.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;8. Begin the script with the shebang `#!/bin/bash` and immediately follow with `set -euo pipefail`.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;9. For file downloads, use `wget -O &lt;output_file&gt; &lt;url&gt;` or `curl -Lfo &lt;output_file&gt; &lt;url&gt;`. Verify successful download (e.g., check exit code). Install `wget` or `curl` if not present (`sudo apt install -y wget curl`).&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;10. If the tutorial involves compiling from source:
        - Ensure necessary general build tools (e.g., `build-essential`, `cmake`, `git`, `pkg-config`) are installed first using `sudo apt install -y ...`.
        - If the tutorial mentions specific library dependencies for compilation (e.g., 'requires libfoo-dev'), ensure these development packages are installed via `sudo apt install -y &lt;package-dev-name&gt;` before running `./configure` or `cmake`.
        - Include typical steps: `cd /path/to/source_code_or_build_dir`, `./configure --prefix=/usr/local` (or as specified by tutorial), `make -j$(nproc)`, `sudo make install`.
        - Clean up build directories after successful installation if appropriate and not needed later.
    &lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;11. Use `echo` statements to clearly inform the user about the script's progress as per `&lt;output_specification&gt;&lt;logging&gt;`.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;12. If the tutorial implies creating or modifying configuration files in system-owned directories (e.g., under `/etc/`, `/usr/share/`), use methods like `echo "content" | sudo tee /path/to/configfile` or `sudo bash -c 'cat &lt;&lt; EOF_FILENAME &gt; /path/to/configfile\nContent line 1\nContent line 2\nEOF_FILENAME'`. Ensure proper quoting and variable expansion if content is dynamic. Always handle with `sudo` correctly.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;13. Ensure the script is self-contained and primarily non-interactive, unless the tutorial explicitly requires user input for configuration (e.g., setting a password) or for critical safety confirmations (see Instruction 16).&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;14. Implement idempotency checks where appropriate as per `&lt;output_specification&gt;&lt;idempotency&gt;`. For example:
        - Check if a directory exists before creating: `if [ ! -d "/path/to/dir" ]; then sudo mkdir -p "/path/to/dir"; fi`
        - Check if a package is installed: `if ! dpkg -s package_name &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then sudo apt install -y package_name; else echo "Package package_name already installed."; fi`
    &lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;15. The final output must be *only* the generated Bash script content, ready to be saved to a `.sh` file. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the script block in the output.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;16. **Critical Safety Confirmation:** For any operation identified as potentially risky (e.g., deleting non-empty directories, overwriting critical configuration files without backup, partitioning/formatting disks if ever mentioned), *YOU MUST* implement an explicit user confirmation. Prompt clearly about the action and its consequences. Example: `read -r -p "WARNING: This will delete /opt/important_data. This action is irreversible. Continue? (yes/NO): " confirmation &amp;&amp; [[ "\$confirmation" == "yes" ]] || { echo "Operation cancelled by user." &gt;&amp;2; exit 1; }`. Adapt the warning message and confirmation string ("yes") as appropriate. Do not use simple [y/N] for highly risky actions.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;17. **Variable Usage:** If the tutorial refers to specific paths, version numbers, URLs, or other values multiple times, define them as variables at the beginning of the script or relevant section for easier modification, clarity, and consistency.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;18. **Bash Functions:** If the tutorial contains sequences of commands that are repeated to achieve the same sub-task or form a distinct logical unit (e.g., setting up a specific service, a common cleanup routine), encapsulate them in Bash functions for better script organization and reusability. Ensure functions also follow error handling practices.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;19. **Temporary File/Directory Management:** If the script needs to create temporary files or directories (e.g., for downloads, intermediate build steps), use `mktemp` or `mktemp -d` to create them securely. Ensure these temporary items are cleaned up, preferably using a `trap` command at the beginning of the script (e.g., `trap 'echo "Cleaning up temporary files..."; rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR_VARIABLE_1" "$TEMP_FILE_VARIABLE_2"' EXIT SIGINT SIGTERM`). Define variables for temp paths.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;20. **Prerequisite Tooling:** Before attempting to use specific commands or tools mentioned in the tutorial (e.g., `jq` for JSON processing, `unzip`, `curl`, `git`, specific compilers beyond `gcc`, language runtimes like `python3-pip`), check if they are installed (e.g., `if ! command -v tool_name &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then ... fi`) and install them using `sudo apt install -y &lt;tool_package_name&gt;` if missing. This applies to build tools, runtime dependencies, and any utility programs.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;21. **Handling Tutorial Structures:** The `[[tutorial_content]]` may be structured with numbered lists, bullet points, headings indicating steps, or inline code blocks (e.g., in Markdown). Parse these elements carefully to accurately identify sequential steps, commands, and their parameters.&lt;/instruction&gt;
    &lt;instruction&gt;22. **Path Usage:** While the script is executed from the user's home directory, ensure all paths to system files and directories (e.g., in `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`, `/opt`) are absolute. Use `~` or `"$HOME"` (quoted) explicitly if an operation is meant to be relative to the user's home directory as per the tutorial's intent. Be cautious with `cd` commands; prefer operating on absolute paths or ensure `cd` changes are localized (e.g., in subshells `(cd /some/path &amp;&amp; command)`) or reliably returned from.&lt;/instruction&gt;
  &lt;/instructions&gt;

        &lt;tutorial_content&gt;
This tutorial guides you through installing Nginx, creating a custom HTML page, and then creating a secure configuration file.

Steps:
1.  Update your package lists.
2.  Install the Nginx web server.
3.  Create a new HTML file named 'rk3588_status.html' in `/var/www/html/`.
4.  The content of 'rk3588_status.html' should be:
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to RK3588!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nginx is running successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
5.  Ensure Nginx is started and enabled.
6.  Create a sensitive configuration file at `/etc/myapp/config.ini`. Content:
    [database]
    host=localhost
    user=app_user
    This file is critical.
        &lt;/tutorial_content&gt;

<p>One day, while studying old code, I found out that it’s possible to encode Windows Portable Executable files as a UNIX Sixth Edition shell script, due to the fact that the Thompson Shell didn’t use a shebang line. Once I realized it’s possible to create a synthesis of the binary formats being used by Unix, Windows, and MacOS, I couldn’t resist the temptation of making it a reality, since it means that high-performance native code can be almost as pain-free as web apps. Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>MZqFpD=’
BIOS BOOT SECTOR’
exec 7&lt;&gt; $(command -v $0)
printf ‘\177ELF…LINKER-ENCODED-FREEBSD-HEADER’ &gt;&amp;7
exec “$0” “$@”
exec qemu-x86_64 “$0” “$@”
exit 1

<p>I started a project called <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">Cosmopolitan</a> which implements the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jart/cosmopolitan/1.0/ape/ape.S">αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> format. I chose the name because I like the idea of having the freedom to write software without restrictions that transcends traditional boundaries. My goal has been helping C become a build-once run-anywhere language, suitable for greenfield development, while avoiding any assumptions that would prevent software from being shared between tech communities. Here’s how simple it is to get started:</p>

<p>gcc -g -O -static -fno-pie -no-pie -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostdinc -o hello.com hello.c <br />
  -Wl,–oformat=binary -Wl,–gc-sections -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 -fuse-ld=bfd -gdwarf-4 <br />
  -Wl,-T,<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.lds">ape.lds</a> -include <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.h">cosmopolitan.h</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/crt.o">crt.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.o">ape.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.a">cosmopolitan.a</a></p>

<p>In the above one-liner, we’ve basically reconfigured the stock compiler on Linux so it outputs binaries that’ll run on MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD too. They also boot from the BIOS. Please note this is intended for people who don’t care about desktop GUIs, and just want stdio and sockets without devops toil.</p>

<h3 id="platform-agnostic-c--c--fortran-tooling">Platform Agnostic C / C++ / FORTRAN Tooling</h3>

<p>Who could have predicted that cross-platform native builds would be this easy? As it turns out, they’re surprisingly cheap too. Even with all the magic numbers, win32 utf-8 polyfills, and bios bootloader code, exes still end up being roughly 100x smaller than Go Hello World:</p>

<p><a href="https://justine.lol/life.com">life.com</a> is 12kb (<a href="https://worker.jart.workers.dev/life.com.dbg">symbols</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jart/cosmopolitan/1.0/examples/life.c">source</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://justine.lol/hello.com">hello.com</a> is 16kb (<a href="https://worker.jart.workers.dev/hello.com.dbg">symbols</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jart/cosmopolitan/1.0/examples/hello.c">source</a>)</p>

<p>Please note that zsh has a minor backwards compatibility glitch with Thompson Shell [update 2021-02-15: <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/commit/326d9c203b3980c0f841bc62b06e37134c6e51ea">zsh has now been patched</a>] so try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sh hello.com</code> rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./hello.com</code>. That one thing aside, if it’s this easy, why has no one done this before? The best answer I can tell is it requires a minor ABI change, where C preprocessor macros relating to system interfaces need to be symbolic. This is barely an issue, except in cases like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switch(errno){case EINVAL:...}</code>. If we feel comfortable bending the rules, then the GNU Linker can easily be configured to generate at linktime all the PE/Darwin data structures we need, without any special toolchains.</p>

<h3 id="pkzip-executables-make-pretty-good-containers">PKZIP Executables Make Pretty Good Containers</h3>

<p>Single-file executables are nice to have. There are a few cases where static executables depending on system files makes sense, e.g. zoneinfo. However we can’t make that assumption if we’re building binaries intended to run on multiple distros with Windows support too.</p>

<p>As it turns out, PKZIP was designed to place its magic marker at the end of file, rather than the beginning, so we can synthesize ELF/PE/MachO binaries with ZIP too! I was able to implement this efficiently in the Cosmopolitan codebase using a few lines of linker script, along with a program for incrementally compressing sections.</p>

<p>It’s possible to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unzip -vl executable.com</code> to view its contents. It’s also possible on Windows 10 to change the file extension to .zip and then open it in Microsoft’s bundled ZIP GUI. Having that flexibility of being able to easily edit assets post-compilation means we can also do things like create an easily distributable JavaScript interpreter that reflectively loads interpreted sources via zip.</p>

<p><a href="https://justine.lol/hellojs.com">hellojs.com</a> is 300kb (<a href="https://worker.jart.workers.dev/hellojs.com.dbg">symbols</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/1.0/examples/hellojs.c">source</a>)</p>

<p>Cosmopolitan also uses the ZIP format to automate compliance with the GPLv2 [update 2020-12-28: APE is now licensed ISC]. The non-commercial libre build is configured, by default, to embed any source file linked from within the hermetic make mono-repo. That makes binaries roughly 10x larger. For example:</p>

<p><a href="https://justine.lol/life2.com">life2.com</a> is 216kb (<a href="https://worker.jart.workers.dev/life2.com.dbg">symbols</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/1.0/examples/life.c">source</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://justine.lol/hello2.com">hello2.com</a> is 256kb (<a href="https://worker.jart.workers.dev/hello2.com.dbg">symbols</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/1.0/examples/hello.c">source</a>)</p>

<p>Rock musicians have a love-hate relationship with dynamic range compression, since it removes a dimension of complexity from their music, but is necessary in order to sound professional. Bloat might work by the same principles, in which case, zip source file embedding could be a more socially conscious way of wasting resources in order to gain appeal with the non-classical software consumer.</p>

<h3 id="x86-64-linux-abi-makes-a-pretty-good-lingua-franca">x86-64 Linux ABI Makes a Pretty Good Lingua Franca</h3>

<p>It wasn’t until very recently in computing history that a clear shakeout occurred with hardware architectures, which is best evidenced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TOP500&amp;oldid=966847096#Architecture_and_operating_systems">TOP 500 list</a>. Outside phones routers mainframes and cars, the consensus surrounding x86 is so strong, that I’d compare it to the Tower of Babel. Thanks to Linus Torvalds, we not only have a consensus on architecture, but we’ve come pretty close to having a consensus on the input output mechanism by which programs communicate with their host machines, via the SYSCALL instruction. He accomplished that by sitting at home in a bathrobe sending emails to huge corporations, getting them to agree to devote their resources to creating something beautifully opposite to tragedy of the commons.</p>

<p>So I think it’s really the best of times to be optimistic about systems engineering. We agree more on sharing things in common than we ever have. There are still outliers like the plans coming out of Apple and Microsoft we hear about in the news, where they’ve sought to pivot PCs towards ARM. I’m not sure why we need a C-Class Macintosh, since the x86_64 patents should expire this year. Apple could have probably made their own x86 chip without paying royalties. The free/open architecture that we’ve always dreamed of, might turn out to be the one we’re already using.</p>

<p>If a microprocessor architecture consensus finally exists, then I believe we should be focusing on building better tools that help software developers benefit from it. One of the ways I’ve been focusing on making a contribution in that area, is by building a friendlier way to visualize the impact that x86-64 execution has on memory. It should should hopefully clarify how αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε works.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that execution starts off by treating the Windows PE header as though it were code. For example, the ASCII string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"MZqFpD"</code> decodes as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pop %r10 ; jno 0x4a ; jo 0x4a</code> and the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"\177ELF"</code> decodes as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jg 0x47</code>. It then hops through a mov statement which tells us the program is being run from userspace rather than being booted, and then hops to the entrypoint.</p>

<p>Magic numbers are then <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/1.0/libc/sysv/systemfive.S">easily unpacked</a> for the host operating system using decentralized sections and the GNU Assembler <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sleb128</code> directive. Low entropy data like UNICODE bit lookup tables will generally be decoded using either a <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/1.0/libc/str/lz4cpy.c">103 byte LZ4 decompressor</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/1.0/libc/nexgen32e/rldecode.S">17 byte run-length decoder</a>, and runtime code morphing can easily be done using Intel’s <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/1.0/third_party/xed/x86ild.greg.c">3kb x86 decoder</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that this emulator isn’t a requirement. αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblεs work fine if you just run them on the shell, the NT command prompt, or boot them from the BIOS. This isn’t a JVM. You only use the emulator if you need it. For example, it’s helpful to be able to have cool visualizations of how program execution impacts memory.</p>

<p>It’ll be nice to know that any normal PC program we write will “just work” on Raspberry Pi and Apple ARM. All we have to do embed an ARM build of the emulator above within our x86 executables, and have them morph and re-exec appropriately, similar to how Cosmopolitan is already doing doing with qemu-x86_64, except that this wouldn’t need to be installed beforehand. The tradeoff is that, if we do this, binaries will only be 10x smaller than Go’s Hello World, instead of 100x smaller. The other tradeoff is the GCC Runtime Exception forbids code morphing, but I already took care of that for you, by rewriting the GNU runtimes.</p>

<p>The most compelling use case for making x86-64-linux-gnu as tiny as possible, with the availability of full emulation, is that it enables normal simple native programs to run everywhere including web browsers by default. Many of the solutions built in this area tend to focus too much on the interfaces that haven’t achieved consensus, like GUIs and threads, otherwise they’ll just emulate the entire operating system, like Docker or Fabrice Bellard running Windows in browsers. I think we need compatibility glue that just runs programs, ignores the systems, and treats x86_64-linux-gnu as a canonical software encoding.</p>

<h3 id="long-lifetime-without-maintenance">Long Lifetime Without Maintenance</h3>

<p>One of the reasons why I love working with a lot of these old technologies, is that I want any software work I’m involved in to stand the test of time with minimal toil. Similar to how the Super Mario Bros ROM has managed to survive all these years without needing a GitHub issue tracker.</p>

<p>I believe the best chance we have of doing that, is by gluing together the binary interfaces that’ve already achieved a decades-long consensus, and ignoring the APIs. For example, here are the <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/1.0/libc/sysv/consts.sh">magic numbers</a> used by Mac, Linux, BSD, and Windows distros. They’re worth seeing at least once in your life, since these numbers underpin the internals of nearly all the computers, servers, and phones you’ve used.</p>

<p>If we focus on the subset of numbers all systems share in common, and compare it to their common ancestor, Bell System Five, we can see that few things about systems engineering have changed in the last 40 years at the binary level. Magnums are boring. Platforms can’t break them without breaking themselves. Few people have proposed visions over the years on why UNIX numerology needs to change.</p>

Blink is designed for portability and includes Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation support for the aarch64 architecture, which your rk3588 utilizes. The absence of the KVM kernel module is not a concern, as Blink operates as a user-mode virtual machine and does not rely on hardware-assisted virtualization like KVM for its x86-64 emulation.</p>

<p><strong>I. Core Purpose of the Blink Project</strong></p>

<p>The Blink project consists of two main components:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blink</code> (Headless Virtual Machine):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This program executes x86-64 Linux applications on diverse operating systems and hardware architectures, including your ARM64-based rk3588.</li>
      <li>It serves as a lightweight alternative to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qemu-x86_64</code> (user-mode QEMU), often with a smaller binary footprint and potentially better performance for certain workloads, especially ephemeral tasks like compilation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code> (Terminal User Interface Debugger):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a TUI-based visual debugger for x86-64 Linux programs (and also supports i8086 real-mode programs).</li>
      <li>It offers unique debugging capabilities, such as visualizing memory changes in real-time using CP437 characters and supporting reverse debugging through scroll wheel interaction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>II. Requirements for Building and Running Blink on Your RK3588</strong></p>

<p><strong>A. Build-Time Dependencies (for compiling Blink from source):</strong></p>

<p>To build Blink on your Debian Bullseye system, you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>C11 Compiler:</strong> GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) version 10.x or newer, typically provided by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build-essential</code> package, is recommended. Blink requires C11 features and atomics support.</li>
  <li><strong>GNU Make:</strong> Version 4.0 or newer.</li>
  <li><strong>Standard Build Utilities:</strong> Tools like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sh</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uname</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tar</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gzip</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xz-utils</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Development Libraries:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>libc6-dev:</strong> For glibc 2.31 development headers.</li>
      <li><strong>zlib1g-dev (Recommended):</strong> For gzip stream processing. Blink can use a vendored copy if this is not found.</li>
      <li><strong>pkg-config (Recommended):</strong> Helps the build system locate libraries.</li>
      <li><strong>libunwind-dev (Optional):</strong> For enhanced backtrace functionality within Blink itself (primarily for Blink developers).</li>
      <li><strong>liblzma-dev (Optional):</strong> May be a dependency of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libunwind-dev</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can install most of these with:</p>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>build-essential pkg-config curl <span class="nb">tar gzip </span>xz-utils zlib1g-dev libunwind-dev liblzma-dev
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>B. Runtime Requirements (for the Blink programs themselves):</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ARM64 (aarch64) Architecture:</strong> Your rk3588 meets this.</li>
  <li><strong>POSIX-compliant OS:</strong> Debian Bullseye with Linux kernel 5.10.</li>
  <li><strong>glibc 2.31:</strong> As specified.</li>
  <li><strong>Sufficient RAM:</strong> Your 32 GiB is more than adequate.</li>
  <li><strong>Sufficient CPU:</strong> Your 8 CPU cores are well-suited, especially for multi-threaded guest applications.</li>
  <li><strong>No KVM Required:</strong> Blink operates entirely in userspace.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>C. Requirements for Guest x86-64 Programs to Run Effectively under Blink:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Executable Format:</strong> Standard x86-64 Linux ELF (static or dynamic), Actually Portable Executables (APE), or flat binary files (ending in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bin</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.img</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.raw</code>).</li>
  <li><strong>C Library (Guest):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Optimal:</strong> Programs built with Cosmopolitan Libc or Musl Libc (e.g., from Alpine Linux) tend to work best due to their reliance on a more standardized syscall subset.</li>
      <li><strong>Generally Good:</strong> Statically linked Glibc programs or dynamically linked ones can also work, though Glibc sometimes uses newer or more obscure Linux-specific syscalls that Blink might not emulate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Syscall Usage:</strong> Guest programs should primarily use POSIX-standard syscalls and common Linux extensions.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Management by Guest:</strong> For best compatibility across different host page sizes (though your Linux setup likely uses 4KB pages), guest programs performing direct memory mapping should ideally query the page size via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getauxval(AT_PAGESZ)</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Compilation Flags for Guest (for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code> debugging):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer</code> (Helps <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code> generate better stack backtraces)</li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>III. Implementation Steps: Building Blink from Source</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Ensure Dependencies are Met:</strong> Install the packages listed in section II.A.</li>
  <li><strong>Clone/Obtain Source Code:</strong> (You have provided this as context).</li>
  <li><strong>Configure the Build:</strong> Navigate to the project’s root directory and run:
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./configure
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Review <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./configure --help</code> for options. For example:
        <ul>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--enable-vfs</code>: If you need more robust chroot-like behavior than the default overlay system.</li>
          <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--disable-jit</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--disable-x87</code>, etc.: To create smaller binaries by removing features (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure --help</code> and the README for details on size savings).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Compile:</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make <span class="nt">-j</span><span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">nproc</span><span class="si">)</span>  <span class="c"># Uses all available CPU cores</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>This will produce executables like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o/blink/blink</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">o/blink/blinkenlights</code> (assuming the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MODE</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Run (Optional Install):</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># To run directly from the build directory:</span>
o/blink/blink /path/to/x86-64-linux-program <span class="o">[</span>args...]
o/blink/blinkenlights /path/to/x86-64-linux-program <span class="o">[</span>args...]

<span class="c"># To install system-wide (optional):</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>make <span class="nb">install
</span>blink /path/to/x86-64-linux-program <span class="o">[</span>args...]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>IV. Leveraging Your RK3588 Hardware</strong></p>

<p>Your rk3588’s specifications are well-suited for Blink:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ARM64 JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation):</strong> Blink’s JIT for aarch64 is a key feature. It translates x86-64 instruction blocks into native ARM64 machine code at runtime. This significantly boosts performance over pure interpretation, making many x86-64 applications run efficiently on your ARM64 CPU.</li>
  <li><strong>32 GiB RAM:</strong> This generous amount of RAM is highly beneficial for:
    <ul>
      <li>Running larger and more memory-intensive x86-64 guest programs.</li>
      <li>Allowing Blink’s JIT to maintain a larger cache of translated code, reducing recompilation overhead.</li>
      <li>Supporting Blink’s linear memory optimization effectively, which aims to map guest memory directly.</li>
      <li>Running multiple Blink instances or other demanding applications alongside Blink without memory contention.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>8 CPU Cores:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>While the core emulation loop for a single guest thread within Blink is single-threaded, if the x86-64 guest application itself is multi-threaded (using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clone()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fork()</code>, pthreads, etc.), Blink will emulate these threads. This allows the guest application to potentially leverage multiple cores on your RK3588, distributing its workload.</li>
      <li>The JIT compilation process itself can also benefit from available CPU resources during its analysis and code generation phases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V. Best Use Cases on Your RK3588 System</strong></p>

<p>Considering your hardware, Blink is ideal for:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Running x86-64 Linux Command-Line Interface (CLI) Tools:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Development &amp; Build Tools:</strong> Execute specific versions of x86-64 compilers (GCC, Clang), build systems (Make, CMake variants), or other development utilities not readily available or suitable in a native ARM64 version. Your 8 cores and 32GB RAM can handle substantial compilation tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Scripting &amp; Interpreters:</strong> Run x86-64 versions of Python, Perl, Node.js, Ruby, etc., for compatibility or specific library needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Use various x86-64 Linux system administration or data processing tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cross-Architecture Development and Debugging:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Compile and test the x86-64 Linux versions of your software directly on your ARM64 machine.</li>
      <li>Utilize <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code> for in-depth visual debugging of these x86-64 binaries, leveraging its unique features to understand program behavior without needing a separate x86-64 machine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Running Lightweight to Moderately Demanding x86-64 Server Applications:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have specific server software (e.g., custom daemons, specialized web services, older database versions) that are only available as x86-64 Linux binaries, Blink can host them. The performance will be less than native ARM64, but for I/O-bound or less CPU-intensive services, it can be a viable solution. Your 32GB RAM allows for more substantial server instances.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Executing Actually Portable Executables (APEs):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Blink is a natural fit for running APEs, which bundle an x86-64 emulator to run on various platforms, including your ARM64 system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Educational and Reverse Engineering Purposes:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code> is an excellent tool for learning x86-64 assembly, understanding low-level program execution, memory layouts, and CPU states.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Isolated x86-64 Environments:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Blink’s filesystem overlay features (or VFS if enabled during configure), you can run x86-64 programs within a chroot-like environment based on a directory from your host system, providing a degree of isolation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>VI. Performance Considerations and Limitations</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Emulation Overhead:</strong> While JIT significantly improves speed, emulating x86-64 on ARM64 will inherently be slower than native execution for CPU-bound tasks. The main emulation loop for a single guest thread is itself single-threaded within Blink.</li>
  <li><strong>No GUI Application Support:</strong> Blink is designed for CLI and TUI applications. It does not emulate X11, Wayland, or other graphical environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Syscall Coverage:</strong> Blink supports a broad set of POSIX and common Linux syscalls. However, applications relying heavily on very new, obscure, or highly specialized Linux-specific syscalls might encounter compatibility issues.</li>
  <li><strong>I/O Performance:</strong> Filesystem and network operations pass through Blink’s emulation layer, which can add some latency compared to native I/O.</li>
  <li><strong>Real Mode (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-r</code> flag with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code>):</strong> While supported for i8086 programs, the primary strength of Blink on your system is its x86-64 long mode emulation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>VII. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code> TUI Specifics</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Terminal Emulator:</strong> A modern UTF-8 terminal emulator that properly supports ANSI escape codes is essential. Recommendations include:
    <ul>
      <li>Linux: KiTTY, Gnome Terminal, Konsole, Xterm.</li>
      <li>Windows (if accessing remotely): PuTTY, Windows Terminal.</li>
      <li>macOS (if accessing remotely): Terminal.app, iTerm2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Font:</strong> A good monospaced font that includes CP437 block characters is recommended for the best visual experience (e.g., PragmataPro, DejaVu Sans Mono/Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, Consolas, Menlo).</li>
  <li><strong>Mouse Support:</strong> While not strictly required, a terminal emulator that forwards mouse events (especially scroll wheel) will enhance the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code> experience, enabling features like reverse debugging via scrolling and zooming memory panels.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, your rk3588 system is a powerful platform for leveraging Blink. You can effectively build it, run a wide array of x86-64 Linux command-line software, and utilize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blinkenlights</code> TUI for debugging and educational purposes, all benefiting from Blink’s ARM64 JIT.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry></feed>
