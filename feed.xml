<p>────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</p>

<p>1) Why autorandr?<br />
autorandr is a Python-based utility that automatically detects and applies display configurations based on the monitors or projectors you connect. It allows you to:<br />
• Save a display setup as a “profile” (e.g., “conference_room,” “classroom_projector,” “ultrawide,” etc.).<br />
• Detect and automatically reapply the saved configuration whenever that monitor or projector is reconnected.<br />
• Eliminate the need for repeated manual xrandr or config file edits.</p>

<p>2) Installing autorandr on openSUSE Tumbleweed<br />
• Check if autorandr is available in openSUSE’s package repositories. For many distributions, it is included or can be accessed via the openSUSE Build Service. You could do, for instance:<br />
  sudo zypper ref &amp;&amp; sudo zypper in autorandr<br />
• If a packaged version is unavailable or outdated, clone the GitHub repository (phillipberndt/autorandr) and run:<br />
  make install<br />
  (or follow the README for alternative install methods such as pip or rpm.)</p>

<p>3) Creating and Using Profiles<br />
Below is a common workflow for a professor who frequently connects to different projectors:</p>

<p>a) Connect to a new projector or monitor and manually adjust resolution/arrangement just once using your desktop’s display settings or xrandr commands.<br />
  b) Save that arrangement as a new autorandr profile, for example:<br />
     autorandr –save classroom1<br />
  c) The next time you plug into that same projector, autorandr detects it and directly applies your “classroom1” configuration. No extra manual steps needed.</p>

<p>You can repeat the steps above for an ultrawide monitor, a second projector, an auditorium projector, etc. Each unique setup can be saved under a different profile name.</p>

<p>4) Automatically Switching Configurations<br />
To let autorandr reconfigure displays automatically whenever the Pi detects a new or removed display device:<br />
• Enable the provided udev/systemd rules, or:<br />
• Use the systemd service that runs autorandr upon display changes.<br />
This ensures you don’t have to issue commands manually each time you attach a projector or unplug a monitor.</p>

<p>5) Catch-All Default Fallback<br />
If no recognized profile matches the newly connected display, autorandr either keeps the current setup or you can specify a “default” profile:<br />
  autorandr –default universalFallback<br />
This might be a simple 1280×720 arrangement that works well on most projectors.</p>

<p>6) Handling Edge Cases or Advanced Needs<br />
• If a projector’s EDID is partially broken or missing, you can use “autorandr –match-edid” or fallback to generic “safe” modes.<br />
• You can still add or override modes with xrandr if needed and re-save with autorandr; the next time, it remembers.<br />
• Optionally, run hook scripts (e.g., “postswitch” in ~/.config/autorandr/) to do tasks such as adjusting wallpaper or launching presentation software whenever a new display profile is loaded.</p>

<p>────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</p>

<p>Summary:<br />
Instead of configuring dozens of resolutions or modelines for all possible projectors, autorandr provides a straightforward “plug it in once, save the profile, auto-detect next time” workflow. This is especially useful for busy educators using the Raspberry Pi 4B on openSUSE Tumbleweed. By collecting each new setup with “autorandr –save”, you can seamlessly connect to 80%+ of commonly encountered projectors or monitors without further xrandr tinkering.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry><entry><title type="html">autorandr2</title><link href="https://ib.bsb.br/autorandr2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="autorandr2" /><published>2025-04-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-03T22:00:40+00:00</updated><id>https://ib.bsb.br/autorandr2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ib.bsb.br/autorandr2/"><![CDATA[<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You are a professor using a Raspberry Pi 4B running openSUSE Tumbleweed, and you frequently need to connect your device to various projectors and ultrawide monitors in different classrooms or lecture halls.

<h3 id="step-2-create-and-save-display-profiles">Step 2: Create and Save Display Profiles</h3>

<p>Initially, connect your Raspberry Pi to a projector or monitor with a common resolution (e.g., 1920x1080) and configure it manually once using your desktop environment’s display settings or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code>. Then save this configuration as a profile:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>autorandr <span class="nt">--save</span> common
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Repeat this step for other common setups you encounter, naming each profile clearly (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ultrawide</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">projector</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lecturehall</code>):</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>autorandr <span class="nt">--save</span> ultrawide

<analysis>
1) Breakdown of Issues in the Initial Response

• Overall Impression and Relevance to Original Query:
  The initial response (which recommended “autorandr” as the solution) is relatively clear in describing the tool’s functions and how it helps avoid repeated manual configuration of displays. However, the user specifically wants a solution for Raspberry Pi 4B running openSUSE Tumbleweed, and the initial answer might not emphasize enough how to handle specific Pi quirks (e.g., GPU memory settings) or the openSUSE Tumbleweed environment. It also doesn’t mention verifying Pi display firmware or referencing official Raspberry Pi docs.

• Specific Parts That Need Improvement:
  “Below is a refactored explanation focusing on how the ‘autorandr’ tool … ”: The text addresses the general workflow but does not fully address:
  1) Potential issues with Pi GPU memory or custom resolutions that require config settings on openSUSE Tumbleweed.  
  2) Additional clarifications for system integration (systemd vs. udev).  

• Missing Information:
  - Additional context about potential Pi-specific configuration steps (GPU memory, config.txt or extraconfig.txt for openSUSE) might be beneficial.  
  - Confirmation that openSUSE Tumbleweed either has or doesn’t have an “autorandr” package is helpful (the initial response references a repository but does not confirm if it’s the best or only route).  

• Logical Inconsistencies:
  - None are overt, though more direct references to typical openSUSE Tumbleweed commands or RasPi firmware might help alignment.  

• Assumptions:
  - The response assumes readers are comfortable working with the terminal and can install packages or compile from source.  
  - The response assumes no major EDID or firmware issues exist beyond standard “autorandr” usage.  

• Structure and Flow:
  - The flow is generally fine, but more clarity in how to adapt to Tumbleweed (especially Pi 4–specific elements) might help. The user wants to handle various projectors on the Pi with minimal fuss, so a short, direct step-by-step approach is suitable.

</analysis>

<plan>
1) Categorization of Issues:
   a) Missing Pi 4–specific references (GPU memory adjustments, config files, or openSUSE Tumbleweed quirks).  
   b) Slightly unclear if “autorandr” is in Tumbleweed’s official repos or if an additional repository is needed.  

2) Prioritized List of Improvements:
   1. Add mention of Pi 4 GPU memory and EDID constraints.  
   2. Clarify “zypper” steps to confirm how to install or whether a separate repo is required.  
   3. Provide a more direct step-by-step approach for Tumbleweed.  

3) Biases or Assumptions:
   - We assume the user can edit system settings on openSUSE Tumbleweed for Pi.  

4) Detailed Steps to Address Issues:
   - Insert references to Raspberry Pi 4’s config and mention verifying GPU memory.  
   - Make “zypper” usage more explicit to confirm either an existing official package or a build service link.  
   - Summarize hooking into systemd or udev for autorandr.  

5) Tone and Style:
   - Maintain the existing professional, explanatory tone.  
   - Keep it concise and user-friendly.  

6) Fact-Checking:
   - Confirm that openSUSE Tumbleweed has the “autorandr” package in the official or “home:phillipberndt” repository.  
   - Confirm that typical steps for Pi 4 GPU memory allocation remain relevant and consistent with openSUSE Tumbleweed’s Pi images.  

7) Alternative Approaches:
   - Possibly mention other tools or scripts (like the built-in openSUSE Tumbleweed display manager for Pi?).  
   - If necessary, mention hardware EDID emulators.  

</plan>

<revised_response>
Below is a refined, step-by-step solution for using “autorandr” on a Raspberry Pi 4B that runs openSUSE Tumbleweed, tailored to frequent projector or ultrawide monitor changes:

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Why “autorandr” on Raspberry Pi 4B with Tumbleweed?  
   • Autorandr automatically detects displays and applies matching profiles without repeated manual xrandr commands. This is ideal when regularly connecting to numerous projectors or ultrawide monitors.  
   • On openSUSE Tumbleweed, the Pi edition supports systemd, enabling autorandr to trigger seamlessly on hardware changes.

2. Confirm GPU Memory and Basic Pi Display Setup  
   • Because the Pi shares memory between CPU and GPU, verify that you’ve allocated enough GPU memory. If you need more than default (e.g., 128–256 MB), adjust /boot/efi/extraconfig.txt accordingly, for instance:  
     gpu_mem=256  
   • Keep your Pi 4 firmware updated (zypper dup) so EDID detection is as reliable as possible.

3. Install autorandr on openSUSE Tumbleweed  
   • Some Tumbleweed images include autorandr in official repositories. If not, you can enable the “home:phillipberndt” repository:  
       sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:phillipberndt/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:phillipberndt.repo  
       sudo zypper refresh  
       sudo zypper install autorandr  
   • Alternatively, you can install via pip:  
       sudo pip install autorandr  

4. Save and Manage Display Profiles  
   • After adjusting your display configuration manually (using Xfce, GNOME, or xrandr), save the current arrangement:  
       autorandr --save projectorA  
   • For an ultrawide monitor:  
       autorandr --save ultrawide  
   Over time, you’ll build a library of profiles for various classrooms and monitors.

5. Automate Profile Switching  
   • By default, you can run:  
       autorandr --change  
     and it attempts to detect the best matching profile.  
   • For truly automatic switching, enable autorandr’s systemd service or udev rule:  
       sudo systemctl enable autorandr.service  
       sudo systemctl start autorandr.service  

6. Setting a Fallback Profile  
   • If you have a “safe” resolution to which you’d like to default if no matching EDID is found, create a “default” profile and set it:  
       autorandr --save fallback  
       autorandr --default fallback  

7. Troubleshooting Tips  
   • Check that your Pi is updated using:  
       sudo zypper dup  
   • Look for EDID or DRM messages in the system logs if a projector isn’t recognized:  
       dmesg | grep -i edid  
   • If you encounter signal or EDID reading issues on older projectors, consider using a short, good-quality HDMI cable or an EDID emulator dongle.

Summary:  
autorandr on Raspberry Pi 4B with openSUSE Tumbleweed allows you to “save once, use anywhere” for your display configurations. Simply configure each projector or ultrawide monitor setup once, save it as a profile, and let autorandr handle detection and automatic switching whenever you connect future displays.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

With these steps, you’ll have a convenient, minimal-effort workflow for presenting slides, connecting to classroom projectors, and hooking up to ultrawide monitors without repeated manual xrandr interventions.

## Leveraging `autorandr` for Seamless Projector and Monitor Connections on Raspberry Pi 4B (openSUSE Tumbleweed)

### Why Use `autorandr`?

`autorandr` automatically detects connected displays and applies pre-saved configurations, eliminating manual adjustments each time you connect to a new projector or monitor. This is ideal for professors frequently moving between classrooms with varying display setups.

### Benefits for Your Scenario:
- **Automatic Detection:** Automatically selects correct display configurations.
- **Ease of Use:** Eliminates repetitive manual configuration.
- **Flexibility:** Manages multiple display profiles easily.
- **Robustness:** Handles common EDID detection issues gracefully.

---

## Step-by-Step Installation and Configuration:

### Step 1: Install `autorandr`

**Recommended Method (openSUSE Build Service):**
```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:phillipberndt/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:phillipberndt.repo
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install autorandr
```

**Alternative Method (pip, limited integration):**
```bash
sudo pip install autorandr
```
*Note: pip installation may not integrate seamlessly with system services like systemd or udev.*

### Step 2: Create and Save Display Profiles

Connect to a projector or monitor, configure manually once, then save:
```bash
autorandr --save classroom_projector
```

Repeat for other setups:
```bash
autorandr --save ultrawide_monitor
```

### Step 3: Verify Saved Profiles
```bash
autorandr --list
```

### Step 4: Automatic Detection and Application

To apply configuration manually:
```bash
autorandr --change
```

To automate this completely, enable autorandr's systemd service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable autorandr.service
sudo systemctl start autorandr.service
```

### Step 5: Create a Default Fallback Profile

Create a generic fallback profile (e.g., 1920x1080):
```bash
autorandr --save default
```

Set as default:
```bash
autorandr --default default
```

---

## Advanced Usage:

### Wildcard EDID Matching (Practical Example)

Edit `~/.config/autorandr/classroom_projector/setup`:
```
HDMI-1 00ffffffffffff00*
```
This matches multiple similar projectors connected to HDMI-1.

---

## Alternative Hardware-Based Solution:

Consider using an **HDMI EDID Emulator** (dummy plug) for consistent EDID data and resolution compatibility without software configuration.

---

## Troubleshooting:

- **List Detected Profiles:**
```bash
autorandr --detected
```

- **Debugging Mode:**
```bash
autorandr --change --debug
```

---

## Official Documentation:

- [autorandr GitHub Repository](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr)
- [openSUSE Build Service autorandr Package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:phillipberndt/autorandr)

---

## Summary:

Using `autorandr`, you can seamlessly manage multiple projector and monitor configurations without manual intervention. Save common setups once, and `autorandr` automatically applies the correct configuration whenever you connect your Raspberry Pi 4B to a new projector or monitor. This simplifies your workflow, allowing you to focus on teaching rather than troubleshooting display issues.

3.  Brainstorm potential areas for elaboration, specific examples that could be added, supporting details, and logical sub-topics relevant to the existing content.
4.  Evaluate the identified points from the original response to determine where expansion would add the most value (e.g., enhancing clarity, providing depth, adding supporting evidence).
5.  Critically assess the brainstormed examples, details, and sub-topics for direct relevance and logical coherence, ensuring they support or extend the original points without deviating from the core purpose.

7.  Analyze the original tone and writing style to ensure the newly generated content integrates seamlessly and consistently.
Develop a structured, detailed plan for executing the expansion. This plan should outline:
* Which specific sections or points of the original response will be expanded.
* What specific details, explanations, examples, or data points will be added to each targeted section.
* Which new, related sub-points (if any) will be introduced and where they fit logically within the existing structure.
* A strategy to ensure the final text flows logically, transitions smoothly, and maintains a consistent tone throughout.
* A projection or check to ensure the planned additions are likely to achieve the target length increase substantively.
Draft the expanded response according to the formulated plan. During the drafting process:
* Systematically integrate the planned details, examples, and explanations into the text.
* Continuously self-correct and refine: check if additions genuinely add substance and value, not just verbosity. Ensure clarity and precision in wording.
* Pay close attention to transitions between original and new content, ensuring they are smooth and logical.
* Monitor the tone and relevance constantly, adjusting as needed to maintain consistency with the original response.
* Keep track of the evolving length to ensure it is progressing towards the target (roughly double).
Produce the final, expanded version of the response. This output should incorporate all planned additions and refinements made during the execution and self-correction phase, resulting in a cohesive, comprehensive, and significantly more detailed text compared to the original.
Before finalizing, review the generated expanded text against the initial requirements and goals:
* Is the length approximately double the original?
* Has the core message, original tone, and focus been strictly maintained?
* Is the added content relevant, accurate, substantial, and well-integrated?
* Does the text flow logically? Is it clear, coherent, and easy to understand?
* Are there any unintended redundancies, awkward phrasing, or areas that could be further polished?

Specify the type of change (e.g., API signature change, logic rewrite, dependency upgrade, schema alteration).Indirect Consequences: Add more specific examples of indirect consequences, such as: ‘If a library is upgraded, how does this affect all modules that use that library, including potential version conflicts or API changes?’ Components relying on modified code. Analyze API contracts meticulously (including implicit contracts). Consider impacts on derived classes, dependent services, data consumers/producers, and UI components. Assess the difficulty of adapting these dependencies.Potential Ripple Effects (NFRs &amp; Systemic Qualities): Analyze impacts quantitatively or qualitatively across:Performance: Baseline key metrics (latency percentiles, throughput, resource utilization). Estimate potential changes and define performance testing requirements.Security: Analyze changes to attack surface, potential introduction/mitigation of specific CWEs, impact on authentication/authorization/encryption, data privacy/residency implications. Define security validation requirements (threat modeling, pen testing).Reliability: Analyze impact on failure modes, error handling, fault tolerance mechanisms, MTBF/MTTR. Define reliability testing needs (e.g., chaos engineering experiments).Maintainability: Code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity), readability, testability, ease of debugging, adherence to coding standards.Operability: Impact on deployment frequency/safety, monitoring effectiveness, logging usefulness, ease of troubleshooting, configuration management complexity.Usability: Add examples of specific usability considerations, such as: ‘Will the refactoring introduce any changes to user workflows? Will it require updates to user documentation or training materials?’ Potential changes to user workflows or interfaces, even if unintentional.Specify the required output format for this analysis to enable clear prioritization and risk assessment. For example: ‘Generate a detailed, sortable, and filterable table listing each affected component (precise identifier), its type, the specific nature of impact, a detailed description of change/interaction, estimated complexity (e.g., Fibonacci scale), likelihood of impact occurring (Low/Med/High), potential severity if impact occurs (Low/Med/High), detectability (Easy/Med/Hard), proposed priority (P1-P4), confidence level of this assessment (Low/Med/High), and initial thoughts on mitigation difficulty.’Generate a Comprehensive, Strategic, Economic, and Actionable Refactoring Plan Document:Strategic Program Blueprint: Construct a detailed, well-organized document titled “Refactoring Plan”. Emphasize its role as the definitive blueprint, central communication artifact, economic justification, risk management framework, and living guide for a potentially long-running, multi-team initiative.Strategic Goals (SMART, Aligned, Measured): Clearly articulate the primary Goals, ensuring they are SMART, directly linked to business OKRs/KPIs and technical strategy (e.g., specific architectural principles, quality attribute targets based on ISO 25010). Define both leading indicators (predicting success during the program) and lagging indicators (measuring success after completion). Add more specific examples of leading and lagging indicators. For example: ‘Leading indicators: % of code refactored, test coverage of refactored code, number of critical vulnerabilities identified and fixed. Lagging indicators: reduction in bug reports, improvement in deployment frequency, reduction in mean time to recovery (MTTR), increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS) due to improved system reliability.’Compelling Rationale &amp; Economic Justification: Provide a robust, data-driven Rationale. Include a formal Cost-Benefit Analysis section: estimate total costs (developer effort, infrastructure changes, tooling, training, potential disruption/downtime, opportunity cost) versus quantifiable benefits (reduced maintenance costs, increased development velocity, improved performance/reliability leading to revenue/retention gains, new market capabilities enabled, specific risk reduction). Calculate estimated ROI or payback period where feasible. Justify the effort against concrete alternatives with their own cost/benefit profiles. Use metrics (code churn, bug density, complexity scores, lead time for changes) to quantify the “cost of inaction.”Granular, Phased Technical Approach (Patterns, Strategies, Observability): Describe the proposed technical Approach in extensive, granular detail, likely broken into distinct phases or workstreams. Outline sequences, specific patterns, algorithms, architectural changes, data handling/migration strategies, and crucially, the observability strategy during the refactoring. Explicitly detail:Preparatory Steps: E.g., enhancing test coverage to a specific target percentage, establishing detailed baseline performance/reliability metrics, setting up required infrastructure/tooling/environments, performing necessary dependency upgrades first, creating Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for key choices.Core Refactoring Steps: Break down major transformations into smaller, verifiable sub-steps. Detail strategies for complex scenarios like database schema evolution (zero-downtime techniques like expand/contract, parallel run with feature flags, trigger-based synchronization), monolith decomposition (Strangler Fig implementation, anti-corruption layers, event-driven decoupling patterns, API gateway integration), managing parallel refactoring efforts across teams (defining clear interfaces, integration points, coordination mechanisms).API Versioning Strategy: Define how APIs will be versioned and managed during the transition to minimize disruption for consumers.Feature Flag Strategy: Detail implementation, rollout strategy (canary, blue-green, percentage-based), A/B testing capabilities if applicable, robust monitoring of flag impact, and rigorous flag cleanup process/timeline.Observability Plan: Define specific metrics, logs, and traces needed to monitor the health, performance, and correctness of both old and new code paths during the transition. Specify required dashboards and alerting.Integration &amp; Verification: Define branching strategy (potentially long-lived release branches for large efforts), CI/CD pipeline adaptations (e.g., parallel pipelines, environment promotion strategy), incremental integration points, and rigorous verification at each stage (automated tests, code reviews, architectural reviews, manual checks).Post-Refactoring Cleanup &amp; Handover: Detail steps for decommissioning old code/flags/infrastructure, updating all relevant documentation comprehensively, final end-to-end validation, knowledge transfer to operations/support teams, and potentially a post-mortem analysis.Data Migration Strategy: Add more detail on how to handle potential data migration challenges. For example: ‘If the refactoring involves changes to the database schema, provide a detailed migration plan, including data validation, rollback procedures, and potential downtime considerations. Consider different migration strategies, such as blue-green deployments or online schema changes.’ Provide a detailed plan for data migration if needed, including validation, rollback, and potential downtime considerations.Elaborate significantly and proactively on potential Risks, brainstorming exhaustively and realistically across categories (Technical, Process, Organizational, Financial, Security, Compliance, External Dependencies). Include complex risks like cascading failures during transition, data corruption undetected for periods, long-running branch divergence hell, team burnout/attrition, knowledge silos hindering progress, configuration drift across complex environments, regulatory/compliance violations introduced, or critical third-party dependencies failing.For each significant identified risk, propose concrete, practical, verifiable, and potentially layered Mitigation Strategies. Include advanced techniques where appropriate: rigorous code reviews (consider checklists), pair/mob programming, comprehensive automated testing pyramid (unit, integration, component, contract, E2E, performance, security scanning, mutation testing) with specific coverage/quality goals, feature flags/toggles, canary releases/blue-green deployments with fine-grained monitoring and automated rollback triggers, dedicated integration/staging environments mirroring production, chaos engineering principles to test resilience, frequent small commits/pushes integrated via robust CI/CD with automated quality gates, automated rollback capabilities (code/config/data), comprehensive data backup/validation/restore drills, formal ADRs for critical decisions, regular stakeholder demos and transparent progress reporting, very clear Definition of Done, external security audits/pen-testing, dedicated refactoring teams or protected time, formal knowledge sharing mechanisms, and potentially architectural fitness functions. Expand on the concept of architectural fitness functions. For example: ‘Define specific architectural fitness functions (automated tests that measure architectural qualities like performance, security, and maintainability) to ensure the refactoring doesn’t degrade the overall architecture. These functions should be continuously monitored throughout the refactoring process.’Include Comprehensive, Detailed Dedicated Sections:Multi-Level Testing Strategy: Define scope, goals, tools, environments, responsibilities, test data management (generation/masking/subsetting), and acceptance criteria for each relevant testing level (unit, integration, component, contract, API, E2E, UAT, performance, load, stress, security, usability, accessibility, disaster recovery, rollback). Include strategy for maintaining test suites during heavy code churn. Add exploratory testing charters.Robust, Validated Rollback Plan: Define precise quantitative triggers for rollback, detailed step-by-step procedures (automated where possible) for reverting code/config/data across all affected systems, validation procedures post-rollback, communication plan during rollback execution, and plan for post-rollback root cause analysis.Integrated Security Validation Plan: Outline when (design, implementation, testing, deployment), how (SAST, DAST, IAST, SCA, manual code review, pen-testing, threat modeling updates, compliance checks), and by whom security will be assessed. Define specific security acceptance criteria and processes for handling identified vulnerabilities.Stakeholder Communication Plan &amp; Matrix: Add a section on ‘Communication and Collaboration Strategy’. This section should detail how the refactoring effort will be communicated to stakeholders, how collaboration will be facilitated between teams, and how conflicts will be resolved. This is crucial for large-scale refactoring projects.Example:’Communication and Collaboration Strategy: Define a clear communication and collaboration strategy to ensure all stakeholders are informed and aligned.Stakeholder Identification and Analysis: Identify all stakeholders (internal and external) and their needs.Communication Channels and Frequency: Define communication channels (e.g., regular meetings, email updates, shared documentation) and frequency for each stakeholder group.Collaboration Mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for collaboration between teams (e.g., shared repositories, communication tools, joint workshops).Conflict Resolution Process: Define a process for resolving conflicts that may arise during the refactoring effort.’Resource Allocation, Skills &amp; Budget: Identify teams/individuals, required skills (include skill gap analysis and training plan if needed), dependencies on shared resources/platforms, detailed effort estimation (e.g., using multiple techniques), realistic timeline with phases/milestones/buffers, and allocated budget.Rigorous Definition of Done (DoD): Define specific, verifiable, agreed-upon criteria for program completion. Provide concrete acceptance conditions and how they will be verified and signed off by specific roles (e.g., Architect, Security Officer, Product Owner, SRE Lead, Business Sponsor).Define the Scope Explicitly, Rigorously, Defensively, Collaboratively, and Visually:Contractual &amp; Visual Scope Section: Integrate a distinct, unambiguous “Scope” section. Explicitly state its purpose as a contract. Use visualization techniques (e.g., architectural diagrams, context maps based on Domain-Driven Design principles) to clearly delineate boundaries.Precise In-Scope Definition: List precisely all artifacts in scope, using unambiguous identifiers. Clearly state the intended change type.Aggressive &amp; Justified Out-of-Scope Definition: Explicitly, extensively, and proactively list anything out of scope, providing the rationale for each exclusion to prevent ambiguity and manage expectations.Formal Scope Change Control Process: Detail the formal process for handling scope change requests, including impact assessment (effort, timeline, risk, cost, dependencies), approval workflow, and integration with program governance and delivery cadences (e.g., sprint planning, PI planning).Identify, Characterize, Justify, Track, and Analyze the Preliminary Change Set:Initial Footprint Prediction &amp; Justification: Compile the preliminary Change Set list based on analysis/scope. Justify the prediction.Categorization, Utility &amp; Tracking: Categorize files clearly. Explain utility for tracking, reviews, CI/CD, parallel work planning. Discuss linking files to work items/tickets. Analyze the set for potential hotspots (frequently changed files needing extra coordination) or impacts on build/deployment infrastructure. Consider using this to inform static analysis rule configurations during the refactoring.Purpose, Limitations &amp; Evolution: Emphasize this is a preliminary estimate expected to evolve. Stress the importance of tracking the actual change set against this baseline to identify scope drift or unexpected impacts early.Embed Iterative Refinement, Continuous Feedback, and Adaptive Governance:Living Document &amp; Governance: Conclude the plan by stating it’s a living document governed by the defined change control process.Review Checkpoints &amp; Cadence: Recommend specific checkpoints, review gates, or cadences (e.g., end-of-phase reviews, quarterly program reviews) where the plan’s validity, assumptions, risks, scope, timeline, and budget are formally reassessed and adapted based on learnings and evolving context.Feedback Loop &amp; Metrics: Emphasize incorporating feedback from retrospectives (specifically focused on the refactoring process), code reviews, testing, monitoring data, and stakeholder input. Define leading metrics to track if the plan is on course before major milestones are missed.Generate a program plan that embodies exceptional thoroughness, strategic alignment, economic awareness, proactive risk management, actionable detail, and adaptive governance, thereby maximizing the probability of a successful, predictable, and high-value enterprise-scale refactoring initiative.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Matthias Steiner lift</title><link href="https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Matthias Steiner lift" /><published>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T08:36:45+00:00</updated><id>https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift/"><![CDATA[<video controls="">

  <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> You install Ventoy onto the external drive once. It creates boot partitions and leaves the remaining space as a large data partition (usually exFAT or NTFS). You then simply copy your OS installer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.iso</code> files, WinPE images (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.iso</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.wim</code>), and even full Windows installations packaged in virtual hard disk files (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhd</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhdx</code>) onto this data partition. When you boot from the Ventoy drive, it scans the data partition and presents a menu listing all compatible files, allowing you to boot directly from them.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Extremely easy to set up and manage – just copy/delete files to add/remove OS options.</li>
      <li>No complex manual partitioning required for each OS.</li>
      <li>Excellent compatibility with UEFI (including Secure Boot) and Legacy BIOS modes.</li>
      <li>Supports a wide variety of image types (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.iso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.wim</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.img</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vhd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vhdx</code>).</li>
      <li>Supports persistence for many Linux live ISOs (saving changes across boots, requires creating a persistence file).</li>
      <li>Can directly boot full Windows installations from VHD(x) files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Slight boot overhead compared to a direct installation (usually negligible).</li>
      <li>Performance of OSs running from VHD(x) depends on the VHD type (fixed vs. dynamic), the underlying drive speed, and the USB connection.</li>
      <li>While compatibility is high, rare niche ISOs might have issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Setup Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Ventoy tool from the official website.</li>
      <li>Run the tool and install Ventoy onto your 1TB external HDD (this will erase the drive initially!). Choose the desired partition scheme (MBR for legacy, GPT for UEFI recommended).</li>
      <li>Once Ventoy is installed, the drive will appear with a large partition. Copy your desired files onto this partition:
        <ul>
          <li>Linux ISOs (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubuntu-lts.iso</code>)</li>
          <li>Windows Installer ISOs (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows11.iso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows81.iso</code>)</li>
          <li>WinPE ISOs or WIMs.</li>
          <li><strong>For full Windows installs (Win 11/8.1 To Go style):</strong> Create a VHD(x) file first:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Method A (Recommended): Install directly to VHD:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disk Management</code> (diskmgmt.msc) in Windows to create a new VHD(x) file (choose VHDX, Fixed size for better performance, allocate sufficient space like 64GB+).</li>
                  <li>Attach the created VHD(x) file in Disk Management (it will appear as a new uninitialized disk). Initialize it (GPT recommended) and create a simple volume (format NTFS).</li>
                  <li>Boot your computer using a standard Windows Installer USB/ISO (you can even boot the Windows ISO via Ventoy itself).</li>
                  <li>At the “Where do you want to install Windows?” screen, press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift+F10</code> to open Command Prompt. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diskpart</code> commands to list volumes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list volume</code>) identify the drive letter of your attached VHD, and select the correct partition.</li>
                  <li>Proceed with the installation, selecting the partition on the attached VHD as the target.</li>
                  <li>After installation completes <em>inside the VHD</em>, detach the VHD in Disk Management.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Method B (Capture Existing):</strong> Use a tool like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disk2vhd</code> (from Microsoft Sysinternals) to capture an existing Windows installation into a VHD(x) file.</li>
              <li>Copy the final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhdx</code> file onto the Ventoy data partition.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Safely eject the drive. Boot your target computer from the USB drive. Ventoy’s menu should appear, allowing you to select and boot your desired OS image or VHD.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<p>To implement this solution:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Save the backup script as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/backup-opensuse.sh</code></li>
  <li>Make it executable: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup-opensuse.sh</code></li>
  <li>Save the service file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/system/backup-opensuse.service</code></li>
  <li>Save the timer file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/system/backup-opensuse.timer</code></li>
  <li>Enable and start the timer:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable backup-opensuse.timer
sudo systemctl start backup-opensuse.timer
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Verify the timer is active:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl list-timers backup-opensuse.timer
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Test the backup manually:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl start backup-opensuse.service
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Monitor the backup progress:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo journalctl -fu backup-opensuse.service
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
