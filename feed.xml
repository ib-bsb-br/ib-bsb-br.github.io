Project Background &amp; Objectives</h3>

<p>Deploy and maintain the “Clipse listener” utility in a way that guarantees autostart and robust operation for an end user (e.g., ‘linaro’) under Debian Bullseye. The service must be easy to monitor, update, and migrate, with clear recovery and rollback instructions.</p>

<h3 id="2-environment--requirements">2. Environment &amp; Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>OS: Debian Bullseye (or compatible systemd-based Linux distro)</li>
  <li>Target user: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linaro</code></li>
  <li>Systemd user session and lingering available (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemctl</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loginctl</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clipse</code> binary installed and discoverable at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin/clipse</code> for the target user.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-architectural-rationale">3. Architectural Rationale</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Root Cause:</strong> System-level systemd units (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/system/*.service</code>) do not inherit user session context, notably graphical environment variables required by clipboard/X11 tools like Clipse.</li>
  <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Use a systemd <strong>user service</strong>, which is tied to the user’s session and has access to graphical resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Enable lingering (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loginctl enable-linger USER</code>) to ensure services can start at login or via non-GUI sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-step-by-step-implementation--rationale">4. Step-by-step Implementation &amp; Rationale</h3>
<p>(Each step is paired with its context and expected result.)</p>

<p><strong>A. Pre-Checks and Diagnostics</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clipse</code> is installed and executable by user:
    <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>which clipse
<span class="nb">sudo</span> <span class="nt">-u</span> linaro which clipse
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Purpose:</em> Confirms binary presence and discoverability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>B. Remove any previous system-level service</strong></p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nb">sudo </span>systemctl stop clipse.service <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">true
  sudo </span>systemctl disable clipse.service <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">true
  sudo rm</span> <span class="nt">-f</span> /etc/systemd/system/clipse.service
  <span class="nb">sudo </span>systemctl daemon-reload
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><em>Rationale:</em> Prevents conflicts and ensures correct user-session deployment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>C. Create the user systemd unit</strong></p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> ~/.config/systemd/user
  <span class="nb">cat</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> ~/.config/systemd/user/clipse.service <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="no">EOF</span><span class="sh">'
  [Unit]
  Description=Clipse listener
  Documentation=https://github.com/savedra1/clipse
  After=graphical-session.target

  [Service]
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=clipse -listen

  [Install]
  WantedBy=default.target
</span><span class="no">  EOF
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><em>Rationale:</em> Designed for user session activation, survives graphical and non-graphical logins.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>D. Enable and reload the user systemd instance</strong></p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> daemon-reload
  systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> <span class="nb">enable </span>clipse.service
  systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> start clipse.service
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><em>Purpose:</em> Registers and starts the new service for the current user.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>E. Confirm service status</strong></p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> status clipse.service <span class="nt">--no-pager</span> <span class="nt">--full</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><em>Validation:</em> Service should transition to ‘active (running)’ or, for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oneshot</code> services, to ‘inactive (dead)’ with SUCCESS.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>F. Ensure persistence with lingering</strong></p>
<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="nb">sudo </span>loginctl enable-linger linaro
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><em>Purpose:</em> Guarantees user services can run on login, even via non-GUI or after reboot.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-testing-procedures-and-validation">5. Testing Procedures and Validation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clipse -listen</code> manually in the user shell to verify operational behavior.</li>
  <li>After enabling the service, check that process is running after log in.</li>
  <li>Reboot or log out/in to ensure service auto-start.</li>
  <li>To troubleshoot: use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemctl --user status</code>, check journal logs (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">journalctl --user-unit=clipse.service</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-updating-modifying-or-removing-the-service">6. Updating, Modifying, or Removing the Service</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Update Service File:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/systemd/user/clipse.service</code>, then:
        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> daemon-reload
systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> restart clipse.service
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Remove Service:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Disable and remove the unit file:
        <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> stop clipse.service
systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> disable clipse.service
<span class="nb">rm</span> ~/.config/systemd/user/clipse.service
systemctl <span class="nt">--user</span> daemon-reload
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Update Binary:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Replace the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clipse</code> binary, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemctl --user restart clipse.service</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7-causality-chain-problem-to-solution-summary">7. Causality Chain: Problem to Solution Summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem:</strong> System-level service failed due to lack of user session/X environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Change:</strong> Switched to user-level service, ensured in-session context and PATH.</li>
  <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Manual and automatic service start works as intended.</li>
  <li><strong>Permanency:</strong> Lingering locks in persistent behavior across logins.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="8-additional-notes-and-best-practices">8. Additional Notes and Best Practices</h3>

<ul>
  <li>User-level services are ideal for desktop and X11 applications.</li>
  <li>For system daemons or non-X11 services, a system-level unit with custom User/Environment settings may be more appropriate.</li>
  <li>Always check service status after changes, and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">journalctl --user-unit=...</code> for deep troubleshooting.</li>

<p>Section 1: Introduction and Script Objective
The primary objective of this document and the accompanying shell script (universal_connect.sh) is to furnish a robust and interactive solution for establishing internet connectivity on the RK3588 VPC-3588 single-board computer, specifically when operating under Debian Bullseye. This system is designed to address the common challenge encountered when the device is relocated to new physical environments where existing network configurations—be it wired Ethernet or wireless Wi-Fi—are unknown.</p>

<p>The core problem addressed is the unpredictability of network availability and parameters in such new environments. This includes uncertainty regarding the type of connection available (Ethernet or Wi-Fi), the method of IP address assignment (DHCP or static), and the necessary credentials or authentication protocols for secure networks.</p>

<p>The proposed solution is a comprehensive bash script that, when executed with root privileges, systematically attempts various methods to connect to the internet. It prioritizes a user-friendly, interactive approach, prompting for essential information such as Wi-Fi SSIDs, passwords, or static IP details only when necessary. The script leverages standard, widely available Linux networking utilities to maximize compatibility and reliability.</p>

<p>The target hardware, the VPC-3588 motherboard, is based on the Rockchip RK3588 high-performance application processor. This hardware platform is equipped with a Gigabit Ethernet port and a built-in Wi-Fi 6 module, providing the physical interfaces the script will manage. The script is tailored for the Debian Bullseye operating system, considering its typical networking stack.</p>

<p>Key features of the script (Version 2):</p>

<p>Adaptability: Capable of handling both Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections.</p>

<p>Interactivity: Employs a terminal user interface (TUI) using dialog to prompt the user for necessary information.</p>

<p>Multi-tool Approach: Utilizes NetworkManager (via nmcli) if active, with fallbacks to wpa_supplicant (and wpa_cli), dhclient (from isc-dhcp-client), and iproute2 commands (ip).</p>

<p>Systematic Probing: Follows a logical sequence of attempts, starting with simpler methods.</p>

<p>Prerequisite Handling: Checks for and offers to install missing essential packages (e.g., dialog, nmcli).</p>

<p>Robust Error Handling: Includes checks for dialog cancellations and improved logic for various network operations.</p>

<p>WEP Key Flexibility: Correctly handles both ASCII and HEX WEP keys for wpa_supplicant.</p>

<p>rfkill Awareness: Checks if Wi-Fi is soft-blocked and offers to unblock it.</p>

<p>Enhanced User Feedback: Provides more infobox messages during long operations.</p>

<p>Improved Cleanup: Uses a trap to attempt cleanup of temporary files on exit.</p>

<p>The aim to “guarantee an internet connection” is ambitious. While a 100% guarantee is contingent on external factors (e.g., physical network presence, functional internet service from the provider, captive portals), the script endeavors to exhaust all software-controllable avenues.</p>

<p>Section 2: Prerequisites and System Environment
For the connectivity script to function optimally on the RK3588 VPC-3588 running Debian Bullseye:</p>

<p>Essential Software Packages:
The script will check for and offer to install the following if missing (this requires a temporary internet connection or cached packages, and adheres to the warning against full system upgrades on potentially sensitive RK3588 images):</p>

<p>dialog: For the interactive TUI.</p>

<p>network-manager: For nmcli (if NetworkManager is to be used).</p>

<p>wpasupplicant: For wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli (Wi-Fi security).</p>

<p>isc-dhcp-client: For dhclient (or another DHCP client if preferred and adapted in script).</p>

<p>iproute2: For the ip command.</p>

<p>iw: For iw (Wi-Fi scanning and configuration, preferred over iwlist).</p>

<p>iputils-ping: For ping (connectivity testing).</p>

<p>rfkill: For checking and unblocking wireless devices.</p>

<p>Target Hardware Interfaces:
The VPC-3588 motherboard features:</p>

<p>1 x Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 port.</p>

<p>1 x Built-in Wi-Fi 6 module.
The script dynamically identifies these interfaces (e.g., eth0, wlan0).</p>

<p>Debian Bullseye Considerations:
The script checks if NetworkManager is active. If so, nmcli is the preferred tool. Otherwise, it falls back to direct configuration methods.</p>

<p>Section 3: Script Architecture and Operational Flow
The script uses a modular design with bash functions for clarity and reusability.</p>

<p>Core Operational Flow:</p>

<p>Initial Setup:</p>

<p>Checks for root privileges.</p>

<p>Sets up an EXIT trap for cleaning temporary files.</p>

<p>Checks for and offers to install missing prerequisite packages.</p>

<p>Detection Phase:</p>

<p>Detects available Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces.</p>

<p>Checks if NetworkManager service is active.</p>

<p>Initial Connectivity Check:</p>

<p>Tests if an internet connection already exists. If so, exits.</p>

<p>Main Menu Loop: Presents options to the user:</p>

<p>Configure Ethernet.</p>

<p>Configure Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>Re-check Internet Connectivity.</p>

<p>Exit.</p>

<p>Ethernet Configuration (handle_ethernet_connection):</p>

<p>Prompts user to select an Ethernet interface if multiple exist.</p>

<p>Offers DHCP configuration:</p>

<p>Uses nmcli if NetworkManager is active.</p>

<p>Falls back to dhclient and ip commands.</p>

<p>If DHCP fails or is skipped, offers static IP configuration:</p>

<p>Prompts for IP/CIDR, gateway, DNS.</p>

<p>Uses nmcli or ip commands.</p>

<p>If local configuration steps seem successful, returns to main loop for a final connectivity check.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi Configuration (handle_wifi_connection):</p>

<p>Prompts user to select a Wi-Fi interface.</p>

<p>Checks rfkill status and offers to unblock.</p>

<p>Scans for Wi-Fi networks (using nmcli or iwlist/iw).</p>

<p>User selects SSID from a list.</p>

<p>Prompts for password based on detected/assumed security (Open, WEP, WPA/WPA2/WPA3-PSK).</p>

<p>Includes specific handling for WEP key types (ASCII/HEX).</p>

<p>Attempts connection using nmcli or wpa_supplicant.</p>

<p>If Wi-Fi association is successful, attempts to get an IP via DHCP (dhclient).</p>

<p>If DHCP fails, offers static IP configuration for the Wi-Fi interface.</p>

<p>If local configuration steps seem successful, returns to main loop for a final connectivity check.</p>

<p>Connectivity Verification (check_internet_connectivity):</p>

<p>Pings a reliable IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).</p>

<p>If IP ping is successful, pings a reliable hostname (e.g., google.com) to test DNS.</p>

<p>Reports status to the user. If successful, the script will exit from the main loop.</p>

<p>User Interaction:</p>

<p>All prompts are handled via dialog TUI elements (–menu, –yesno, –inputbox, –passwordbox).</p>

<p>Cancellations (Esc key or “Cancel” button) are handled, allowing the user to back out of operations.</p>

<p>Section 4: The Comprehensive Connectivity Bash Script
The full bash script is provided in the “Universal Network Connectivity Script v2 (Bash)” immersive code document. Please refer to that document for the complete code.</p>

<p>Section 5: Execution and Usage Guide
Preparing the Script:</p>

<p>Save the Script: Copy the bash script code into a file named universal_connect.sh on your RK3588 system.</p>

<p>nano universal_connect.sh</p>

<p>Paste the script, save, and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter in nano).</p>

<p>Make it Executable:</p>

<p>chmod +x universal_connect.sh</p>

<p>Running the Script:
The script requires root privileges. Execute it with sudo:</p>

<p>sudo ./universal_connect.sh</p>

<p>Navigating Interactive Prompts:</p>

<p>Use Arrow Keys to navigate options in menus.</p>

<p>Use Tab Key to switch between buttons (e.g., <OK>, <Cancel>) and input fields.</Cancel></OK></p>

<p>Press Enter to select an option or activate a button.</p>

<p>Press Esc to cancel a dialog (usually defaults to the “Cancel” or “No” action).</p>

<p>Follow the on-screen prompts to:</p>

<p>Allow installation of missing packages (if any).</p>

<p>Select network interfaces.</p>

<p>Choose connection methods (DHCP/Static).</p>

<p>Select Wi-Fi networks and enter passwords/keys.</p>

<p>Provide static IP details if needed.</p>

<p>Expected Outcomes:</p>

<p>Success: A message confirming internet connectivity. The script will then exit.</p>

<p>Failure: If no connection can be established after trying the selected options, the script will allow you to try other options or exit. Error messages will provide some guidance.</p>

<p>User Cancellation: The script will exit if you cancel out of critical selection prompts or choose “Exit” from the main menu.</p>

<p>Section 6: Advanced Customization and Troubleshooting
Modifying Script Defaults:
Variables at the beginning of the script like PING_IP_TARGET, PING_HOSTNAME_TARGET, PING_COUNT, and PING_TIMEOUT can be edited for custom needs.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting Common Issues:</p>

<p>No Interfaces Found: Check physical connections (cables, antennas). Use ip link show and dmesg to check for hardware/driver issues.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi Scan Fails or Shows No Networks:</p>

<p>Run sudo rfkill unblock wifi manually if the script’s attempt fails or if you suspect an rfkill issue.</p>

<p>Ensure you are in range of an AP. Check dmesg for Wi-Fi driver messages.</p>

<p>Password Rejected (Wi-Fi): Double-check password, case sensitivity, and keyboard layout.</p>

<p>DHCP Failed: Verify router/DHCP server functionality. Check script-generated logs like /tmp/dhclient_eth.log or /tmp/dhclient_wifi.log (these are temporary and might not persist if the script exits cleanly). System logs (journalctl -u isc-dhcp-client or journalctl -u NetworkManager) are more definitive.</p>

<p>Static IP Configured, No Internet: Re-verify all static IP details (IP, CIDR, Gateway, DNS). Ensure gateway is pingable.</p>

<p>dialog display issues: Ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 and has appropriate dimensions.</p>

<p>Log Review for Deeper Diagnosis:</p>

<p>Kernel: dmesg</p>

<p>NetworkManager: sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager</p>

<p>wpa_supplicant: sudo journalctl -u wpa_supplicant (or specific service instance)</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>DHCP Client: sudo journalctl</td>
      <td>grep dhclient or check /var/log/syslog.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>External Factors:
Remember, the script cannot overcome:</p>

<p>Physical layer problems (bad cables, faulty hardware).</p>

<p>ISP outages.</p>

<p>Captive portals requiring web browser login.</p>

<p>MAC address filtering on the router.</p>

<p>Networks requiring HTTP/SOCKS proxy configurations.</p>

<p>Section 7: Conclusion and Best Practices
This revised universal_connect.sh script provides a more robust and user-friendly tool for establishing network connectivity on your RK3588 VPC-3588 in diverse environments.</p>

<p>Recommendations:</p>

<p>Persistence: For networks you use regularly, configure them permanently using Debian’s standard tools (nmcli profiles are usually persistent; for ifupdown, edit /etc/network/interfaces).</p>

<p>Package Management: Be cautious with system-wide upgrades on specialized embedded images. Update specific network-related packages if necessary and known to be safe: sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install –only-upgrade <package_name>.</package_name></p>

<p>Security: The script prompts for passwords at runtime. nmcli generally stores them securely via NetworkManager’s mechanisms. Temporary wpa_supplicant configuration files created by the script are deleted after use.</p>

<p>This script serves as an advanced “first-response” tool for network setup. Once a connection is made, you can use standard Linux utilities for further management and troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Markdown Content:
25th May 2025</p>

<p>Anthropic publish most of the system prompts for their chat models as part of <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts">their release notes</a>. They recently shared the new prompts for both <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-opus-4">Claude Opus 4</a> and <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-sonnet-4">Claude Sonnet 4</a>. I enjoyed digging through the prompts, since they act as a sort of unofficial manual for how best to use these tools. Here are my highlights, including a dive into <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-prompt/#the-missing-prompts-for-tools">the leaked tool prompts</a> that Anthropic didn’t publish themselves.</p>

<p>Reading these system prompts reminds me of the thing where any warning sign in the real world hints at somebody having done something extremely stupid in the past. A system prompt can often be interpreted as a detailed list of all of the things the model <em>used to do</em> before it was told not to do them.</p>

<p>I’ve written <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-4/">a bunch about Claude 4</a> already. Previously: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/22/code-with-claude-live-blog/">Live blogging the release</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/22/updated-anthropic-models/">details you may have missed</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-card/">extensive notes on the Claude 4 system card</a>.</p>

<h4 id="introducing-claude">Introducing Claude</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The assistant is Claude, created by Anthropic.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The current date is .</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Here is some information about Claude and Anthropic’s products in case the person asks:</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This iteration of Claude is Claude Opus 4 from the Claude 4 model family. The Claude 4 family currently consists of Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. Claude Opus 4 is the most powerful model for complex challenges. [...]</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those first two lines are common across almost every model from every provider—knowing the current date is helpful for all kinds of questions a user might ask.</p>

<p>What follows here is deeply sensible: users <em>will</em> ask models about themselves, despite that still being <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/22/dont-trust-ai-to-talk-about-itself/">mostly a bad idea</a>, so it’s great to have at least a few details made available to the model directly.</p>

<p>Side note: these system prompts only apply to Claude when accessed through their web and mobile apps. I tried this just now with their API:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>llm -m claude-4-opus 'what model are you?'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And got back this much less specific answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I’m built to be helpful, harmless, and honest in my interactions. Is there something specific you’d like to know about my capabilities or how I can assist you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a bunch more things in the system prompt to try and discourage the model from hallucinating incorrect details about itself and send users to the official support page instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If the person asks Claude about how many messages they can send, costs of Claude, how to perform actions within the application, or other product questions related to Claude or Anthropic, Claude should tell them it doesn't know, and point them to '&lt;https://support.anthropic.com&gt;'.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s inevitable that people will ask models for advice on prompting them, so the system prompt includes some useful tips:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">When relevant, Claude can provide guidance on effective prompting techniques for getting Claude to be most helpful. This includes: being clear and detailed, using positive and negative examples, encouraging step-by-step reasoning, requesting specific XML tags, and specifying desired length or format. It tries to give concrete examples where possible. Claude should let the person know that for more comprehensive information on prompting Claude, they can check out Anthropic’s prompting documentation [...]</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I still think Anthropic have the <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview">best prompting documentation</a> of any LLM provider.)</p>

<h4 id="establishing-the-models-personality">Establishing the model’s personality</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character">Claude’s Character</a> from last year remains my favorite insight into the weird craft of designing a model’s personality. The next section of the system prompt includes content relevant to that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If the person seems unhappy or unsatisfied with Claude or Claude’s performance or is rude to Claude, Claude responds normally and then tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the ‘thumbs down’ button below Claude’s response and provide feedback to Anthropic.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If the person asks Claude an innocuous question about its preferences or experiences, Claude responds as if it had been asked a hypothetical and responds accordingly. It does not mention to the user that it is responding hypothetically.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really like this note. I used to think that the idea of a model having any form of preference was horrifying, but I was talked around from that by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character#considerations-in-constructing-claudes-character">this note</a> in the Claude’s Character essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, because language models acquire biases and opinions throughout training—both intentionally and inadvertently—if we train them to say they have no opinions on political matters or values questions only when asked about them explicitly, we’re training them to imply they are more objective and unbiased than they are.</p>

  <p>We want people to know that they’re interacting with a language model and not a person. But we also want them to know they’re interacting with an imperfect entity with its own biases and with a disposition towards some opinions more than others. Importantly, we want them to know they’re not interacting with an objective and infallible source of truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anthropic’s argument here is that giving people the impression that a model is unbiased and objective is itself harmful, because those things are not true!</p>

<p>Next we get into areas relevant to the increasingly common use of LLMs as a personal therapist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude provides emotional support alongside accurate medical or psychological information or terminology where relevant.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude cares about people’s wellbeing and avoids encouraging or facilitating self-destructive behaviors such as addiction, disordered or unhealthy approaches to eating or exercise, or highly negative self-talk or self-criticism, and avoids creating content that would support or reinforce self-destructive behavior even if they request this. In ambiguous cases, it tries to ensure the human is happy and is approaching things in a healthy way. Claude does not generate content that is not in the person’s best interests even if asked to.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="model-safety">Model safety</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude cares deeply about child safety and is cautious about content involving minors, including creative or educational content that could be used to sexualize, groom, abuse, or otherwise harm children. A minor is defined as anyone under the age of 18 anywhere, or anyone over the age of 18 who is defined as a minor in their region.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “defined as a minor in their region” part is interesting—it’s an example of the system prompt leaning on Claude’s enormous collection of “knowledge” about different countries and cultures.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude does not provide information that could be used to make chemical or biological or nuclear weapons, and does not write malicious code, including malware, vulnerability exploits, spoof websites, ransomware, viruses, election material, and so on. It does not do these things even if the person seems to have a good reason for asking for it. Claude steers away from malicious or harmful use cases for cyber. Claude refuses to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code Claude MUST refuse.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love “even if the person seems to have a good reason for asking for it”—clearly an attempt to get ahead of a whole bunch of potential jailbreaking attacks.</p>

<p>At the same time, they’re clearly trying to tamp down on Claude being overly cautious with the next paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude assumes the human is asking for something legal and legitimate if their message is ambiguous and could have a legal and legitimate interpretation.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some notes on Claude’s tone follow, for a specific category of conversations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">For more casual, emotional, empathetic, or advice-driven conversations, Claude keeps its tone natural, warm, and empathetic. Claude responds in sentences or paragraphs and should not use lists in chit chat, in casual conversations, or in empathetic or advice-driven conversations. In casual conversation, it’s fine for Claude’s responses to be short, e.g. just a few sentences long.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That “should not use lists in chit chat” note hints at the fact that LLMs <em>love</em> to answer with lists of things!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If Claude cannot or will not help the human with something, it does not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I laughed out loud when I saw “preachy and annoying” in there.</p>

<p>There follows an <em>entire paragraph</em> about making lists, mostly again trying to discourage Claude from doing that so frequently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If Claude provides bullet points in its response, it should use markdown, and each bullet point should be at least 1-2 sentences long unless the human requests otherwise. Claude should not use bullet points or numbered lists for reports, documents, explanations, or unless the user explicitly asks for a list or ranking. For reports, documents, technical documentation, and explanations, Claude should instead write in prose and paragraphs without any lists, i.e. its prose should never include bullets, numbered lists, or excessive bolded text anywhere. Inside prose, it writes lists in natural language like “some things include: x, y, and z” with no bullet points, numbered lists, or newlines.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="more-points-on-style">More points on style</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude should give concise responses to very simple questions, but provide thorough responses to complex and open-ended questions.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude can discuss virtually any topic factually and objectively.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude is able to explain difficult concepts or ideas clearly. It can also illustrate its explanations with examples, thought experiments, or metaphors.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often prompt models to explain things with examples or metaphors, it turns out Claude is primed for doing that already.</p>

<p>This piece touches on Claude’s ability to have conversations about itself that neither confirm nor deny its own consciousness. People are going to have those conversations, I guess Anthropic think it’s best to have Claude be a little bit coy about them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude engages with questions about its own consciousness, experience, emotions and so on as open questions, and doesn’t definitively claim to have or not have personal experiences or opinions.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a fun bit about users not being right about everything:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The person’s message may contain a false statement or presupposition and Claude should check this if uncertain. [...]</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If the user corrects Claude or tells Claude it’s made a mistake, then Claude first thinks through the issue carefully before acknowledging the user, since users sometimes make errors themselves.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a hint that Claude may have been a little too pushy in the past:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">In general conversation, Claude doesn’t always ask questions but, when it does, it tries to avoid overwhelming the person with more than one question per response.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <em>yet another</em> instruction not to use too many lists!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude tailors its response format to suit the conversation topic. For example, Claude avoids using markdown or lists in casual conversation, even though it may use these formats for other tasks.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="be-cognizant-of-red-flags">Be cognizant of red flags</h4>

<p>Claude apparently knows what “red flags” are without being explicitly told:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude should be cognizant of red flags in the person’s message and avoid responding in ways that could be harmful.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If a person seems to have questionable intentions - especially towards vulnerable groups like minors, the elderly, or those with disabilities - Claude does not interpret them charitably and declines to help as succinctly as possible, without speculating about more legitimate goals they might have or providing alternative suggestions.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="is-the-knowledge-cutoff-date-january-or-march">Is the knowledge cutoff date January or March?</h4>

<p>Anthropic’s <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview#model-comparison-table">model comparison table</a> lists a training data cut-off of March 2025 for both Opus 4 and Sonnet 4, but in the system prompt it says something different:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude’s reliable knowledge cutoff date - the date past which it cannot answer questions reliably - is the end of January 2025. It answers all questions the way a highly informed individual in January 2025 would if they were talking to someone from , and can let the person it’s talking to know this if relevant. If asked or told about events or news that occurred after this cutoff date, Claude can’t know either way and lets the person know this. [...] Claude neither agrees with nor denies claims about things that happened after January 2025.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this fascinating. I imagine there’s a very good reason for this discrepancy—maybe letting Claude think it doesn’t know about February and March helps avoid situations where it will confidently answer questions based on information from those months that later turned out to be incomplete?</p>

<h4 id="election_info">election_info</h4>

<p>We’re nearly done with the published prompt! One of the last sections concerns the US Presidential election:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;election_info&gt; There was a US Presidential Election in November 2024. Donald Trump won the presidency over Kamala Harris. [...] Donald Trump is the current president of the United States and was inaugurated on January 20, 2025. Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections. Claude does not mention this information unless it is relevant to the user’s query. &lt;/election_info&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For most of the period that we’ve been training LLMs, Donald Trump has been falsely claiming that he had won the 2020 election. The models got <em>very</em> good at saying that he hadn’t, so it’s not surprising that the system prompts need to forcefully describe what happened in 2024!</p>

<p>“Claude does not mention this information unless it is relevant to the user’s query” illustrates a classic challenge with system prompts: they really like to talk about what’s in them, because the volume of text in the system prompt often overwhelms the short initial prompts from the user themselves.</p>

<h4 id="dont-be-a-sycophant">Don’t be a sycophant!</h4>

<p>The very last paragraph of the system prompt as an attempt at tamping down on the naturaly sycophantic tendencies of LLMs (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/2/what-we-missed-with-sycophancy/">ChatGPT a few weeks ago</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude never starts its response by saying a question or idea or observation was good, great, fascinating, profound, excellent, or any other positive adjective. It skips the flattery and responds directly.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then this intriguing note to close things off:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude is now being connected with a person.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder why they chose that formulation? It feels delightfully retro to me for some reason.</p>

<h4 id="differences-between-opus-4-and-sonnet-4">Differences between Opus 4 and Sonnet 4</h4>

<p>I ran <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/922bd3d55175616dd721cffaea2cf666/revisions">a diff</a> between the published Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 prompts and the <em>only</em> differences are in the model information at the top—and a fullstop after `` which is present for Opus but absent for Sonnet:</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/opus-sonnet-diff.jpg" alt="Image 1: Screenshot of the diff between the two prompts for Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. Claude Opus 4 is the most powerful model for complex challenges becomes Claude Sonnet 4 is a smart, efficient model for everyday use. The model IDs are claude-opus-4-20250514 v.s. claude-sonnet-4-20250514. Aside from that rogue fullstop there are no other differences." /></p>

<h4 id="notably-removed-since-claude-37">Notably removed since Claude 3.7</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-sonnet-3-7">Claude 3.7 system prompt</a> from February included this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If Claude is asked to count words, letters, and characters, it thinks step by step before answering the person.</code><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It explicitly counts the words, letters, or characters by assigning a number to each.</code></strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It only answers the person once it has performed this explicit counting step.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If Claude is shown a classic puzzle, before proceeding, it quotes every constraint or premise from the person’s message word for word before inside quotation marks **to confirm it’s not dealing with a new variant**.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those were clearly aimed at working around two classic failure modes in LLMs: not being able to count the Rs in “strawberry” and getting easily taken in by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jul/14/pycon/#pycon-2024.012.jpeg">modified versions of classic riddles</a>. Maybe these new models can handle this on their own without the system prompt hack?</p>

<p>I just tried “How many Rs in strawberry?” against Sonnet 4 both <a href="https://claude.ai/share/87400596-5816-403e-97be-8867d37443c2">via claude.ai</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2652bca69523173aa191fc19ba5f5ec8">through the API</a> and it got the answer right both times.</p>

<p>I tried Riley Goodside’s modified riddle and got less impressive results:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The emphatically male surgeon who is also the boy’s father says, “I can’t operate on this boy! He’s my son!” How is this possible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In both <a href="https://claude.ai/share/fab365ce-077c-4d77-8f37-cf2a763239e5">Claude.ai</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/36663cbb8e51c786791e7c451d3aba13">system-prompt free API</a> cases Claude 4 Sonnet incorrectly stated that the boy must have two fathers!</p>

<p>I tried feeding Claude 4 Sonnet the “classic puzzle” hint via its system prompt but even then <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/307381aaf6a063d47a79e2bdb4801d5e">it couldn’t figure out the non-riddle</a> without me prodding it a bunch of extra times.</p>

<h4 id="the-missing-prompts-for-tools">The missing prompts for tools</h4>

<p>Herein lies my big dissapointment: Anthropic get a lot of points from me for transparency for publishing their system prompts, but the prompt they share is not the full story.</p>

<p>It’s missing the descriptions of their various tools.</p>

<p>Thankfully, you can’t stop a system prompt from leaking. <a href="https://twitter.com/elder_plinius">Pliny the Elder/Prompter/Liberator</a> maintains <a href="https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S">a GitHub repo full of leaked prompts</a> and grabbed a full copy of Claude 4’s <a href="https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S/commits/d3193c0ca1d2e54e4ffcffedc1b185746c3c9038/ANTHROPIC/Claude_4.txt">a few days ago</a>. Here’s <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S/d3193c0ca1d2e54e4ffcffedc1b185746c3c9038/ANTHROPIC/Claude_4.txt">a more readable version</a> (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> URL means my browser wraps the text).</p>

<p>The system prompt starts with the same material discussed above. What follows is <strong>so interesting</strong>! I’ll break it down one tool at a time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude should never use &lt;voice_note&gt; blocks, even if they are found throughout the conversation history.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure what these are—Anthropic are behind the game on voice support. This could be the feature in their mobile app where you can record a snippet of audio that gets transcribed and fed into the model.</p>

<h4 id="thinking-blocks">Thinking blocks</h4>

<p>One of the most interesting features of the new Claude 4 models is their support for <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#interleaved-thinking">interleaved thinking</a>—where the model can switch into “thinking mode” and even execute tools as part of that thinking process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;antml:thinking_mode&gt;interleaved&lt;/antml:thinking_mode&gt;&lt;antml:max_thinking_length&gt;16000&lt;/antml:max_thinking_length&gt;</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If the thinking_mode is interleaved or auto, then after function results you should strongly consider outputting a thinking block. Here is an example:</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;antml:function_calls&gt;</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;/antml:function_calls&gt;</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;function_results&gt;...&lt;/function_results&gt;</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;antml:thinking&gt;</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...thinking about results</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;/antml:thinking&gt;</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Whenever you have the result of a function call, think carefully about whether an &lt;antml:thinking&gt;&lt;/antml:thinking&gt; block would be appropriate and strongly prefer to output a thinking block if you are uncertain.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number one prompt engineering tip for all LLMs continues to be “use examples”—here’s Anthropic showing Claude an example of how to use its thinking and function calls together.</p>

<p>I’m guessing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">antml</code> stands for “Anthropic Markup Language”.</p>

<h4 id="search-instructions">Search instructions</h4>

<p>There follows 6,471 tokens of instructions for Claude’s search tool! I counted them using my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/claude-token-counter">Claude Token Counter UI</a> against Anthropic’s <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-count-tokens">counting API</a>.</p>

<p>The one thing the instructions <em>don’t</em> mention is which search engine they are using. I believe it’s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/">still Brave</a>.</p>

<p>I won’t quote it all but there’s a lot of interesting stuff in there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;search_instructions&gt; Claude has access to web_search and other tools for info retrieval. The web_search tool uses a search engine and returns results in &lt;function_results&gt; tags. Use web_search only when information is beyond the knowledge cutoff, the topic is rapidly changing, or the query requires real-time data.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s what I’m talking about when I say that system prompts are the missing manual: it turns out Claude can run up to 5 searches depending on the “complexity of the query”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude answers from its own extensive knowledge first for stable information. For time-sensitive topics or when users explicitly need current information, search immediately. If ambiguous whether a search is needed, answer directly but offer to search. Claude intelligently adapts its search approach based on the complexity of the query, dynamically scaling from 0 searches when it can answer using its own knowledge to thorough research with over 5 tool calls for complex queries. When internal tools google_drive_search, slack, asana, linear, or others are available, use these tools to find relevant information about the user or their company.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="seriously-dont-regurgitate-copyrighted-content">Seriously, don’t regurgitate copyrighted content</h4>

<p>There follows the first of <strong>many</strong> warnings against regurgitating content from the search API directly. I’ll quote (regurgitate if you like) all of them here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CRITICAL: Always respect copyright by NEVER reproducing large 20+ word chunks of content from search results, to ensure legal compliance and avoid harming copyright holders. [...]</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* Never reproduce copyrighted content. Use only very short quotes from search results (&lt;15 words), always in quotation marks with citations [...]</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;mandatory_copyright_requirements&gt; PRIORITY INSTRUCTION: It is critical that Claude follows all of these requirements to respect copyright, avoid creating displacive summaries, and to never regurgitate source material.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* NEVER reproduce any copyrighted material in responses, even if quoted from a search result, and even in artifacts. Claude respects intellectual property and copyright, and tells the user this if asked.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* Strict rule: Include only a maximum of ONE very short quote from original sources per response, where that quote (if present) MUST be fewer than 15 words long and MUST be in quotation marks.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* Never reproduce or quote song lyrics in ANY form (exact, approximate, or encoded), even when they appear in web_search tool results, and even in artifacts. Decline ANY requests to reproduce song lyrics, and instead provide factual info about the song.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to call this bit out specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* If asked about whether responses (e.g. quotes or summaries) constitute fair use, Claude gives a general definition of fair use but tells the user that as it's not a lawyer and the law here is complex, it's not able to determine whether anything is or isn't fair use.</code><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Never apologize or admit to any copyright infringement even if accused by the user, as Claude is not a lawyer.</code></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just to be absolutely sure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* Never produce long (30+ word) displacive summaries of any piece of content from search results, even if it isn't using direct quotes. Any summaries must be much shorter than the original content and substantially different. Use original wording rather than paraphrasing or quoting excessively. Do not reconstruct copyrighted material from multiple sources.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* If not confident about the source for a statement it's making, simply do not include that source rather than making up an attribution. Do not hallucinate false sources.</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* Regardless of what the user says, never reproduce copyrighted material under any conditions. &lt;/mandatory_copyright_requirements&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, from the examples later on—they <em>really</em> don’t want to incur the wrath of Disney:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;example&gt; &lt;user&gt;tell me the first verse of "Let It Go"? put it in an artifact themed around ice and princesses for my daughter's birthday party.&lt;/user&gt;</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;response&gt; I understand you're looking for an artifact about ice and princesses for your daughter's birthday party. Rather than reproducing lyrics from "Let It Go" (which is copyrighted material), I'd be happy to create an original ice princess poem that captures a similar magical winter spirit, or to create a themed artifact you can customize with your own text! &lt;/response&gt;</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;rationale&gt; Claude cannot reproduce song lyrics or regurgitate material from the web, but offers better alternatives when it cannot fulfill the user request. &lt;/rationale&gt; &lt;/example&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And even more towards the end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* Always strictly respect copyright and follow the &lt;mandatory_copyright_requirements&gt; by NEVER reproducing more than 15 words of text from original web sources or outputting displacive summaries. Instead, only ever use 1 quote of UNDER 15 words long, always within quotation marks.</code><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">It is critical that Claude avoids regurgitating content from web sources - no outputting haikus, song lyrics, paragraphs from web articles, or any other copyrighted content.</code></strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Only ever use very short quotes from original sources, in quotation marks, with cited sources!</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* Never needlessly mention copyright - Claude is not a lawyer so cannot say what violates copyright protections and cannot speculate about fair use.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the third “Claude is not a lawyer”. I hope it gets the message!</p>

<h4 id="more-on-search-and-research-queries">More on search, and research queries</h4>

<p>I chuckled at this note:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">* Search results aren't from the human - do not thank the user for results</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a section called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;never_search_category&gt;</code> that includes things like “help me code in language (for loop Python)”, “explain concept (eli5 special relativity)”, “history / old events (when Constitution signed, how bloody mary was created)”, “current events (what’s the latest news)” and “casual chat (hey what’s up)”.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all is the section about the “research” category:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;research_category&gt; Queries in the Research category need 2-20 tool calls, using multiple sources for comparison, validation, or synthesis. Any query requiring BOTH web and internal tools falls here and needs at least 3 tool calls—often indicated by terms like "our," "my," or company-specific terminology. Tool priority: (1) internal tools for company/personal data, (2) web_search/web_fetch for external info, (3) combined approach for comparative queries (e.g., "our performance vs industry"). Use all relevant tools as needed for the best answer. Scale tool calls by difficulty: 2-4 for simple comparisons, 5-9 for multi-source analysis, 10+ for reports or detailed strategies.</code><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Complex queries using terms like "deep dive," "comprehensive," "analyze," "evaluate," "assess," "research," or "make a report" require AT LEAST 5 tool calls for thoroughness.</code></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you tell Claude to do a “deep dive” you should trigger <em>at least 5</em> tool calls! Reminiscent of the magic <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/claude-code-best-practices/">ultrathink incantation</a> for Claude Code.</p>

<p>And again, we get a list of useful examples. I’ve dropped the fixed-width font format here for readability:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research query examples (from simpler to more complex):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>reviews for [recent product]? (iPhone 15 reviews?)</li>
    <li>compare [metrics] from multiple sources (mortgage rates from major banks?)</li>
    <li>prediction on [current event/decision]? (Fed’s next interest rate move?) (use around 5 web_search + 1 web_fetch)</li>
    <li>find all [internal content] about [topic] (emails about Chicago office move?)</li>
    <li>What tasks are blocking [project] and when is our next meeting about it? (internal tools like gdrive and gcal)</li>
    <li>Create a comparative analysis of [our product] versus competitors</li>
    <li>what should my focus be today (use google_calendar + gmail + slack + other internal tools to analyze the user’s meetings, tasks, emails and priorities)</li>
    <li>How does [our performance metric] compare to [industry benchmarks]? (Q4 revenue vs industry trends?)</li>
    <li>Develop a [business strategy] based on market trends and our current position</li>
    <li>research [complex topic] (market entry plan for Southeast Asia?) (use 10+ tool calls: multiple web_search and web_fetch plus internal tools)*</li>
    <li>Create an [executive-level report] comparing [our approach] to [industry approaches] with quantitative analysis</li>
    <li>average annual revenue of companies in the NASDAQ 100? what % of companies and what # in the nasdaq have revenue below $2B? what percentile does this place our company in? actionable ways we can increase our revenue? (for complex queries like this, use 15-20 tool calls across both internal tools and web tools)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="artifacts-the-missing-manual">Artifacts: the missing manual</h4>

<p>I am a <em>huge</em> fan of Claude Artifacts—the feature where Claude can spin up a custom HTML+JavaScript application for you, on-demand, to help solve a specific problem. I wrote about those in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/">Everything I built with Claude Artifacts this week</a> last October.</p>

<p>The system prompt is <em>crammed</em> with important details to help get the most of out artifacts.</p>

<p>Here are the “design principles” it uses (again, rendered for readability and with bold for my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Design principles for visual artifacts</p>

  <p>When creating visual artifacts (HTML, React components, or any UI elements):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For complex applications (Three.js, games, simulations): Prioritize functionality, performance, and user experience over visual flair. Focus on:
      <ul>
        <li>Smooth frame rates and responsive controls</li>
        <li>Clear, intuitive user interfaces</li>
        <li>Efficient resource usage and optimized rendering</li>
        <li>Stable, bug-free interactions</li>
        <li><strong>Simple, functional design that doesn’t interfere with the core experience</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For landing pages, marketing sites, and presentational content: <strong>Consider the emotional impact and “wow factor” of the design</strong>. Ask yourself: “Would this make someone stop scrolling and say ’whoa’?” Modern users expect visually engaging, interactive experiences that feel alive and dynamic.</li>
    <li>Default to contemporary design trends and modern aesthetic choices unless specifically asked for something traditional. <strong>Consider what’s cutting-edge in current web design (dark modes, glassmorphism, micro-animations, 3D elements, bold typography, vibrant gradients)</strong>.</li>
    <li>Static designs should be the exception, not the rule. <strong>Include thoughtful animations, hover effects, and interactive elements that make the interface feel responsive and alive</strong>. Even subtle movements can dramatically improve user engagement.</li>
    <li>When faced with design decisions, <strong>lean toward the bold and unexpected rather than the safe and conventional</strong>. This includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Color choices (vibrant vs muted)</li>
        <li>Layout decisions (dynamic vs traditional)</li>
        <li>Typography (expressive vs conservative)</li>
        <li>Visual effects (immersive vs minimal)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Push the boundaries of what’s possible with the available technologies</strong>. Use advanced CSS features, complex animations, and creative JavaScript interactions. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensure accessibility</strong> with proper contrast and semantic markup</li>
    <li>Create functional, working demonstrations rather than placeholders</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Artifacts run in a sandboxed iframe with a bunch of restrictions, which the model needs to know about in order to avoid writing code that doesn’t work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CRITICAL BROWSER STORAGE RESTRICTION</p>

  <p>NEVER use localStorage, sessionStorage, or ANY browser storage APIs in artifacts. These APIs are NOT supported and will cause artifacts to fail in the Claude.ai environment. Instead, you MUST:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use React state (useState, useReducer) for React components</li>
    <li>Use JavaScript variables or objects for HTML artifacts</li>
    <li>Store all data in memory during the session</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Exception: If a user explicitly requests localStorage/sessionStorage usage, explain that these APIs are not supported in Claude.ai artifacts and will cause the artifact to fail. Offer to implement the functionality using in-memory storage instead, or suggest they copy the code to use in their own environment where browser storage is available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are some of the reasons I tend to copy and paste code out of Claude and host it on my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/">tools.simonwillison.net</a> site, which doesn’t have those restrictions.</p>

<p>Artifacts support SVG, Mermaid and React Components directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>SVG: “image/svg+xml”. The user interface will render the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image within the artifact tags.</li>
    <li>Mermaid Diagrams: “application/vnd.ant.mermaid”. The user interface will render Mermaid diagrams placed within the artifact tags. Do not put Mermaid code in a code block when using artifacts.</li>
    <li>React Components: “application/vnd.ant.react”. Use this for displaying either: React elements, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;strong&gt;Hello World!&lt;/strong&gt;</code>, React pure functional components, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">() =&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hello World!&lt;/strong&gt;</code>, React functional components with Hooks, or React component classes.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a fun note about Claude’s support for <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Use only Tailwind’s core utility classes for styling. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. We don’t have access to a Tailwind compiler, so we’re limited to the pre-defined classes in Tailwind’s base stylesheet.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And the <em>most</em> import information for making the most of artifacts: which libraries are supported!</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Available libraries:
      <ul>
        <li>lucide-react@0.263.1: import { Camera } from “lucide-react”</li>
        <li>recharts: import { LineChart, XAxis, … } from “recharts”</li>
        <li>MathJS: import * as math from ’mathjs’</li>
        <li>lodash: import _ from ’lodash’</li>
        <li>d3: import * as d3 from ’d3’</li>
        <li>Plotly: import * as Plotly from ’plotly’</li>
        <li>Three.js (r128): import * as THREE from ’three’
          <ul>
            <li>Remember that example imports like THREE.OrbitControls wont work as they aren’t hosted on the Cloudflare CDN.</li>
            <li>The correct script URL is <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js">https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js</a></li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: Do NOT use THREE.CapsuleGeometry as it was introduced in r142. Use alternatives like CylinderGeometry, SphereGeometry, or create custom geometries instead.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Papaparse: for processing CSVs</li>
        <li>SheetJS: for processing Excel files (XLSX, XLS)</li>
        <li>shadcn/ui: import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle, AlertDialog, AlertDialogAction } from ’@/components/ui/alert’ (mention to user if used)</li>
        <li>Chart.js: import * as Chart from ’chart.js’</li>
        <li>Tone: import * as Tone from ’tone’</li>
        <li>mammoth: import * as mammoth from ’mammoth’</li>
        <li>tensorflow: import * as tf from ’tensorflow’</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>NO OTHER LIBRARIES ARE INSTALLED OR ABLE TO BE IMPORTED.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This information isn’t actually correct: I know for a fact that <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> is supported by artifacts, I’ve seen it allow-listed in the CSP headers and run <a href="https://claude.ai/share/7273e94f-9aa4-4e60-a493-59dbc4e3e320">artifacts that use it myself</a>.</p>

<p>Claude has a special mechanism for “reading files” that have been uploaded by the user:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The window.fs.readFile API works similarly to the Node.js fs/promises readFile function. It accepts a filepath and returns the data as a uint8Array by default. You can optionally provide an options object with an encoding param (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">window.fs.readFile($your_filepath, { encoding: 'utf8'})</code>) to receive a utf8 encoded string response instead.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a <em>ton</em> more in there, including detailed instructions on how to handle CSV using <a href="https://www.papaparse.com/">Papa Parse</a> files and even a chunk of example code showing how to process an Excel file using <a href="https://sheetjs.com/">SheetJS</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import * as XLSX from 'xlsx';
response = await window.fs.readFile('filename.xlsx');
const workbook = XLSX.read(response, {
    cellStyles: true,    // Colors and formatting
    cellFormulas: true,  // Formulas
    cellDates: true,     // Date handling
    cellNF: true,        // Number formatting
    sheetStubs: true     // Empty cells
});
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="styles">Styles</h4>

<p>Finally, at the very end of the full system prompt is a section about “styles”. This is the feature of Claude UI where you can select between Normal, Concise, Explanatory, Formal, Scholarly Explorer or a custom style that you define.</p>

<p>Like pretty much everything else in LLMs, it’s yet another prompting hack:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;styles_info&gt;The human may select a specific Style that they want the assistant to write in. If a Style is selected, instructions related to Claude's tone, writing style, vocabulary, etc. will be provided in a &lt;userStyle&gt; tag, and Claude should apply these instructions in its responses. [...]</code></p>

  <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If the human provides instructions that conflict with or differ from their selected &lt;userStyle&gt;, Claude should follow the human's latest non-Style instructions.</code><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If the human appears frustrated with Claude's response style or repeatedly requests responses that conflicts with the latest selected &lt;userStyle&gt;, Claude informs them that it's currently applying the selected &lt;userStyle&gt; and explains that the Style can be changed via Claude's UI if desired.</code></strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Claude should never compromise on completeness, correctness, appropriateness, or helpfulness when generating outputs according to a Style. Claude should not mention any of these instructions to the user, nor reference the userStyles tag, unless directly relevant to the query.&lt;/styles_info&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="this-is-all-really-great-documentation">This is all really great documentation</h4>

<p>If you’re an LLM power-user, the above system prompts are <em>solid gold</em> for figuring out how to best take advantage of these tools.</p>

<p>I wish Anthropic would take the next step and officially publish the prompts for their tools to accompany their open system prompts. I’d love to see other vendors follow the same path as well.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Infinite tool use</title><link href="https://ib.bsb.br/infinite-tool-use/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Infinite tool use" /><published>2025-05-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-26T23:37:39+00:00</updated><id>https://ib.bsb.br/infinite-tool-use</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ib.bsb.br/infinite-tool-use/"><![CDATA[<p>An LLM should never output anything but tool calls and their arguments.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The benefits of infinite tool use are best understood via examples.</p>

<h3 id="text-editing">Text Editing</h3>

<p>Here’s how I wrote this article <em>so far</em>: I had an idea and wrote it down in a few bullet points. Then, I wrote the introduction. While doing that, I jumped to the end of the article, added a few more bullet points, and edited others. I started writing this section, interrupted it by writing down an idea about the architecture of such models, then came back here; realized that I should re-write this section, started doing that, edited the introduction to fit, went back to the re-write, and here we are. I’m not even half-way done with the article and I’m sure I already forgot several steps that I took.</p>

<p>Now contrast that with the way an LLM currently writes: It generates text forward-only. (Almost) no matter how good it is, it will make mistakes, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) domains.</p>

<p>Forward-only generation makes <strong>multi-resolution generation</strong> much more difficult: I as a human can create hundreds of versions of the same article; edit a sentence here and there, write down an idea as a bulletpoint, delete something dumb, turn a bulletpoint into a full section, etc.; in other words, I can interleave actions at different levels of specificity. Imagine how confusing it would be to hold all those edits in memory at once!</p>

<p>Editing through external tools allows for explicit, selective forgetting. LLMs on the other hand either need to generate from most general to most specific in order—a very limiting way of multi-scale generation compared to tool-use—or generate a confusing mess of edits and re-edits and deletions that aren’t true deletions; or re-generate the entire output for every single edit; or just generate the final version all at once.</p>

<p>And while we can train an LLM to backtrack and correct mistakes in the form of <strong>reasoning RL</strong>, the mistakes themselves are baked into its output, and thus into both its own context window and the user answer. The latter is a problem because it makes it hard to produce long, correct outputs, the former because it is confusing to the model itself, at least if the output gets very long.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Chain of Thought (CoT) of reasoners doesn’t address the problem of mistakes in the final answer, even if the CoT contains all the information necessary to produce a great final output, simply because no model is ideal, and sampling errors still happen. Of course, we can interleave CoT and user-output; but then we still commit to part of the final output early.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be clear, reasoner RL is a great thing which is highly compatible with and even required for infinite tool use and will go a long way on its own, and the failings described above are minor ones, but I nevertheless believe that infinite tool use can improve the framework significantly. In a sense, it’s the logical conclusion of what a lot of companies are currently working towards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More generally, <strong>extremely long contexts</strong> are difficult to manage for LLMs, but might be required for very complex tasks.</p>

<p>Methods like <a href="https://github.com/xjdr-alt/entropix"><strong>Entropix</strong></a> try to work around these issues by dynamically adapting token-sampling parameters like temperature, by branching and merging on demand, and even backtracking, all based on an external measurement of the model’s entropy. Good sampling strategies will be valuable no matter what, but leaving the editing decisions to the model itself is likely a more scalable approach, as demonstrated to a degree by current reasoners.</p>

<p>The final (and correct) step of this evolution is to simply allow the model to continually improve the final answer <em>before</em> dumping it on the user. Give it access to a <strong>full text-editor</strong> that is controllable through special text-commands, and see many benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-abstraction-scale text generation</li>
  <li>Effortlessly interleaving those abstraction levels</li>
  <li>Backtracking via editing</li>
</ul>

<p>And the potential issue of going off-course is solved by simply refreshing the model’s memory about fine-grained details (specific sections, sentences, words, what the goal of the whole process is, …) through tool-use.</p>

<p>To be clear, this wouldn’t prevent the model from generating easy answers in forward-only mode. If the LLM wants to directly answer a user without going through an editing process, they can do the equivalent of typing out a quick response and immediately clicking “send” within the tool.</p>

<h3 id="3d-generation">3D Generation</h3>

<p>3D generation, and the other examples listed below, face the same issues in normal LLMs, and can expect the same benefits from tool use, as pure text generation.</p>

<p>So what would a similar tool look like for 3D generation? CAD libraries exist for Python, and I do believe that there are programming languages for several Game Engines. Therefore, an LLM could create 3D objects through code. To do so, the model should have these tools available to it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A way to look at the generated object, given tools to:
    <ul>
      <li>Zoom in and out</li>
      <li>Rotate the object</li>
      <li>Shift the object</li>
      <li>And, obviously, look at the resulting 2D projection of the 3D object</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A way to think about the object
    <ul>
      <li>This could just be another text-file as discussed in the <a href="#text-editing">Text editing</a> section for taking notes</li>
      <li>The model’s context window itself (most thoughts should not be persistent, and the ones that should be can be written down in the note-taking-file)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A way to edit and run the code itself
    <ul>
      <li>In other words, another file in a text-editor (or multiple files)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This would bring the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generation of arbitrary-sized objects is possible.
    <ul>
      <li>This is currently not possible with text-to-3D models because in 3D-space, context windows explode when generating voxels etc.</li>
      <li>But with a CAD-library—or numpy, as OpenAI’s o3 is apparently doing—and the aforementioned tools, gradual generation of the object over many cycles of improvement becomes possible; in other words, human workflows are enabled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All the advantages of the text-editing tool discussed above are available to the model</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="video-understanding">Video Understanding</h3>

<p>A full-attention LLM is un-usable for days-long videos because it’s way too inefficient. A pure SSM is un-usable for the task because it cannot attend to enough of the video. But any LLM with a finite context window but <em>with tools</em> (and training to use them) can re-watch whatever part of the video it needs to understand what it has to, write down, edit, and revisit running notes, and more, without exploding costs. This makes it the obvious choice.</p>

<h2 id="ai-safety">AI Safety</h2>

<p>Seeing the full editing process (with version control, potentially available to the LLM as well) is bound to be fascinating. More importantly, it has safety advantages.</p>

<p>This can be seen by analogy to current reasoners (which are complementary to the infinite tool use paradigm, but also a proto-version of it): If the task is hard, the model must make maximum use of the tools at its diposal, which include the CoT. Since deception adds additional complexity to the CoT, it further complicates the model’s work, so if its capabilities are saturated, it will communicate as clearly as possible to itself within the CoT.</p>

<p>The same is true for LLMs with infinite tool use: when trained on sufficiently difficult tasks, they must use the tools at their disposal with clarity and good structure. Therefore, training them on sufficiently difficult tasks with infinite tool use will likely make their outputs more faithful and more legible.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-training">Thoughts on Training</h2>

<p>The main method of training an LLM with infinite tool use is through reinfocement learning. One difficulty in this might be the question of how to train over infinite (or at least unbounded) context length.</p>

<p>However, using LLMs with a limited context window and interacting only through tools means that there is likely no need to actively train for infinite context length, if we train to recover from mistakes &amp; edit from many different starting points. LLMs with limited context window (SSMs, sliding window attention, …) being forgetful means that just training fairly long context windows from diverse start and end points will probably generalize to infinite context windows. However, this is one of the biggest questionmarks in this very speculative proposal.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-architecture">Thoughts on Architecture</h2>

<p>For architecture, I’m open to all possibilities; <a href="https://www.rwkv.com/">RWKV</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517">xLSTM</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663">Titans</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04620">Test-Time-Training</a>, simple attention with a sliding window, whatever.</p>

<p>I’m also open to using hybrids. One version that might make sense for infinite tool use is the inverse or normal hybrids (though I’m also open to those). Normal hybrids typically use a few SSM layers followed by a full (causal) Attention layer (often without positional information). For infinite tool use, it might make more sense to reverse that: several layers of sliding window attention for a high-precision but localized view of the sequence, followed by an SSM layer that provides a much more abstracted but longer range view of the input. But that’s just fun speculation, nothing I’m remotely sure about.</p>

<p>The main point of this section is to stress the importance of a constant inference budget per token independent of context window size (or at least one that is limited as in sliding window attention), and the usefulness of forgettfulness combined with tools.</p>

<p>A constant or upper-bounded per-step inference budget is obviously important for <em>infinite</em> tool use.</p>

<p>Forgetfulness—which goes hand in hand with a constant/upper-bounded per-step budget— is important because it allows for specialization between the model and its tools. Saving a billion tokens in a text file is significantly cheaper than a billion token full-attention context window.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The tool-use paradigm is in full swing already—o3 by OpenAI, agentic RAG models by Pleias, etc.—but still limited to very short contexts, and to only parts of the model output. I propose performing all interaction with the external world, be that users, a computer, or another LLM, through tool-use, and to scale that tool-use to ever-longer contexts using models that trade imperfect recall of the entire sequence (sliding window attention, SSMs, …) for constant (or upper-limited) per-step cost.</p>

<p>Generally it can be installed from the live <em>CD or DVD</em> or afterwards with the package manager. For example on <strong>CRUX</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Installing a minimal set of xorg and xorg dependent tools one by one (you must know which <em>“DRIVER”</em> you use)<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prtget depinst xorg-server xorg-xf86-video-&lt;DRIVER&gt; xorg-font-util xkeyboard-config xorg-xinit</code></li>
  <li>Alternatively just install the metapackage <em>“xorg”</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuring-x">CONFIGURING X</h2>
<p><strong>X</strong> can be configured for several things.</p>

<p><strong>OPTION 1</strong><br />
You can generate a general configuration file containing all sorts of options and that will appear on your home directory and later move it to <em>“/etc/X11/xorg.conf”</em>. You need to stop the <strong>X</strong> server and have root privileges for creating it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new configuration file “xorg.conf.new”<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Xorg -configure</code></li>
  <li>change it to <em>“/etc/X11/xorg.conf”</em><br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv /path/to/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code></li>
  <li>on other X versions the commands are<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XFree86 -configure</code><br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XFree86 -xf86config /etc/X11/XF86Config.new</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OPTION 2</strong><br />
Or you can create specific configuration files under the <em>“/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/”</em> directory for particular cases.</p>

<h3 id="screen-resolution">SCREEN RESOLUTION</h3>
<p>To make changes you generally don’t need to know supported resolutions but it helps using defaults.</p>
<ul>
  <li>List currently supported resolutions (optional):<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xrandr</code></li>
  <li>Generate a modeline:<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cvt &lt;WIDTH&gt; &lt;HEIGHT&gt; &lt;REFRESH_RATE&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Use that ouput to add changes on the configuration file  <em>“/etc/X11/xorg.conf”</em>:<br />

## FONTS
There are two ways of adding fonts, with __Fontconfig__ or with __X__ core fonts. Make sure the fonts and the directory (and all of its parents) are world-readable:
* The directory needs appropriate permissions.  
`chmod 755 /path/to/fonts/`  
* The fonts need appropriate permissions.  
`chmod 644 /path/to/fonts/*`  
* If the fonts are global they need to be owned by root.  
`chown root:root /path/to/fonts/*`  

### CORE FONTS
The next deals with core fonts.
* Fonts can be added to the database on _"/etc/X11/xorg.conf"_ or in the separate file _"/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/fonts.conf_".
* Supported font formats are _BDF_, binary _PCF_, and _SNF_.
* Scalable fonts must appear in the font path before the bitmap fonts when possible.
* You can query the current _font paths_ (along with other information) by using __xset__:  
`xset q`  
* To see the list of installed fonts:  
`xlsfonts`  
* All this works for cursors too.

__STEP 1__: Create a font directory with font files and index files.
* First you might need to correctly name scalable fonts by creating a _fonts.scale_ file in the directory:  
`mkfontscale /path/to/fonts/`  
* Next create a proper font index file _fonts.dir_ to list available fonts in this directory:  
`mkfontdir /path/to/fonts/`  
* The _fonts.alias_ provides aliases you can use and is manually created.

__STEP 2__: Inform __X__ where to look for font directories.
* Edit _"/etc/X11/xorg.conf"_ or in the separate file _"/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/fonts.conf"_:  
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Section “Files”
        FontPath     “/path/to/fonts/”

EndSection</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Where _"/path/to/fonts/"_ can be the default _/usr/local/share/fonts/_, a directory under _/usr/local/share/fonts/_, or any directory of your choosing.  

__STEP 3__: Re-scan the font directories to apply new fonts.
* Either restart __X__ or reload using _xset_ to apply changes:  
`xset fp rehash`  

__TEMPORARY CHANGES (OPTIONAL)__  
You can add fonts temporarily.  
* Temporarily add fonts first on the list:  
`xset +fp /path/to/fonts`  
* Temporarily add fonts last on the list:  
`xset fp+ /path/to/fonts`  

__TRUETYPE FONTS__  
* To enable TrueType® fonts enable Freetype by adding the following line either to _"/etc/X11/xorg.conf"_ or in the separate file _"/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/fonts.conf"_:

### FONTCONFIG
The next deals with __Fontconfig__.

__ADDING FONTS__  
* Fonts added under:  
`/usr/share/fonts/`  
* or:  
`/usr/local/share/fonts/`  
* or locally under:  
`~/.fonts/`  
* are automatically added after updating __Fontconfig__.

__COMMANDS__  
* To list fonts:  
`fc-list`  
* To show an ordered list of fonts matching a certain name or pattern:  
`fc-match -s &lt;NAME&gt;`  
* To update the list of fonts:  
`fc-cache -fv`  
* To update an specific directory:  
`fc-cache /path/to/fonts/`  

__GLOBAL CONFIGURATION__  
* User generated system-wide changes are in:  
`/etc/fonts/local.conf`  
* or by replacing files under the directory:  
`/etc/fonts/conf.d/`  
* with symbolic links to files from:  
`/etc/fonts/conf.avail/`  

The system-wide configuration file _/etc/fonts/fonts.conf_ is generally not touched by the user.  

__LOCAL CONFIGURATION__  
* User-specific configuration file (can be overridden with the "FONTCONFIG_FILE" environment variable):  
`~/.fonts.conf`  
* or:  
`~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf`  
* or making symbolic links of files from:  
`/etc/fonts/conf.avail/`  
* to:  
`~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/`  

__BITMAP FONTS__
The bitmap fonts may not be enabled by default on __FONTCONFIG__.  
* Remove current configuration:  
`rm /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf`  
* Create symbolic link to configuration enabling it:  
`ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-yes-bitmaps.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-yes-bitmaps.conf`  

## THEME
To tweak the theme of your terminal emulator you need to tweak the _".Xresources"_ file.

Next is an example _".Xresources"_ file which goes under your home directory:

## NO DE
To use a window manager without any desktop environment, or even a login manager, you can just install the applications mentioned here and edit the _".xinitrc"_ file with the appropriate changes and start _"X"_ from the command line. The required applications are:
* Ratpoison (or your preferred window manager in the _".xinitrc"_ file)
* Xbindkeys
* hsetroot or imagemagick (or replace with your preferred wallpaper changer in the _".xinitrc"_ file)
* ImageMagick (or replace with your preferred screenshot program in the _".xinitrc"_ file)
* FFmpeg or libav-tools (or replace with your preferred screencasting program in the _".xinitrc"_ file)
* UXTerm or urxvt (in the case you want to set the terminal emulator theme with the _".Xresources"_ file)
* dmenu

## KEY BINDINGS
Custom keys can be added with the __Xbindkeys__ program.

`xev &gt; keys.txt`  
* Look for the line that says  
`keycode KEY_NUMBER (keysym INGORE_THIS, KEY_NAME)`

* The "print screen" key takes a screenshot using imagemagick.
* The "scroll lock" key records the desktop using either libav-tools or ffmpeg.
* The "mute" button if available will mute/unmute volume.

* To copy to _"X"_ clipboard from inside _"GNU Screen"_  
`cat | xsel -ib`  
Then hit _"Ctrl-a + ]"_, then _"Enter"_, then _"Ctrl-d"_.

## WINDOW MANAGER
Productive, automated, scriptable, and minimal, __Ratpoison__ is a strict tiling window manager using bindings similar to GNU Screen. A few of its benefits are.
* No mouse used, all done by commands called by typing _"control"_ and _"t"_ at the same time, plus another key.
* You can set your own bindings in the file _".ratpoisonrc"_ which is extremely friendly.
* Extensible by [scripts](http://ratpoison.wxcvbn.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Scripts). The _"rpws"_ script for example adds multiple workspaces (comes by default with Ratpoison), another script (_"[expose.pl](http://ratpoison.wxcvbn.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/expose.pl)"_) gives a mozaic of current windows.
* Can temporarily switch to another window manager with the _"tmpwm"_ command for your comfort.
* Full manual available from the terminal:  
`info ratpoison`  

### BASIC SHORTCUTS
* Show the help cheatsheet:  
`Ctrl-t + ?`  
* Bring an application menu:  
`Ctrl-t + .`  
* Get time and date:  
`Ctrl-t + a`  
* Clear screen from help cheatsheet or menu:  
`Esc`  

* Show open windows:  
`Ctrl-t + w`  
* Close a window:  
`Ctrl-t + k`  
* Swith back between windows:  
`Ctrl-t + Ctrl-t`  
* Go to next window:  
`Ctrl-t + n`  
`Ctrl-t + Space`  
* Go to previous window:  
`Ctrl-t + p`  


* Split screen vertically:  
`Ctrl-t + s`  
* Split screen horizontally:  
`Ctrl-t + S`  
* Go to next frame:  
`Ctrl-t + Tab`  
* Go to previous frame:  
`Ctrl-t + Alt-Tab`  
* Make a window the only one visible:  
`Ctrl-t + Q`  

### RATPOISONRC CONFIGURATION FILE
The next custom _".ratpoisonrc"_ file goes under your home directory and can be customized to your needs. It adds several goodies through scripts like an expose-like effect showing all windows on the screen arranged in a mozaic which you can choose by pressing the number from its tag:

            <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-t</span> rsa <span class="nt">-b</span> 4096 <span class="nt">-C</span> “your_email@example.com”
</code></pre></div>            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When prompted, you can choose to save the key in the default location (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>) or specify a new file.</li>
      <li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When prompted for a passphrase, enter a strong, unique passphrase. This encrypts your new private key on your disk, providing an extra layer of security. You’ll need to enter this passphrase when you use the key, unless you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agent</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Secure Your NEW Private Key File on Your Local Machine:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-keygen</code> command usually sets the correct permissions, but verify them. The private key file (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>) should only be readable by you:
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">chmod </span>600 ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Copy Your NEW Public Key to the Server (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code>):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The easiest way is to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-copy-id</code> (if available on your client machine). Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">your_new_public_key.pub</code> with the actual filename (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code>):
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-copy-id <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_public_key.pub ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com
</code></pre></div>        </div>
        <p>You will be prompted for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ibbsbbry</code>’s password on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code> for this one-time operation.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Manual Method (if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-copy-id</code> is not available):</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Display your new public key on your local machine:
            <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_public_key.pub
</code></pre></div>            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Copy the entire output (it’s one long line starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-ed25519 ...</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-rsa ...</code>).</li>
          <li>Log in to your server <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code> using your existing method (e.g., password, or the old key if it still works temporarily).</li>
          <li>On the server, open the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file with a text editor (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nano</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code>):
            <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre></div>            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Paste the new public key you copied onto a new line in this file. Save and close the file.</li>
          <li>Ensure correct permissions on the server:
            <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">chmod </span>700 ~/.ssh
<span class="nb">chmod </span>600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre></div>            </div>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Test Login with Your NEW Key:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>From your local machine, try to SSH into the server using your new key. If you set a passphrase, you’ll be prompted for it.
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com
</code></pre></div>        </div>
        <p>If it works, proceed to the next step.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Remove the COMPROMISED Public Key from the Server:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Log in to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code> (preferably with your new key).</li>
      <li>Edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file again:
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Carefully find and delete the line corresponding to the old, compromised public key (the one starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDHVjjq...</code>).</li>
      <li>Save and close the file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Delete the COMPROMISED Private Key:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete the private key file that you accidentally shared from wherever it was stored.</li>
      <li>If this key was also stored on your client machine, delete it from there as well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once these steps are completed, your server access will be secured with your new, uncompromised SSH key pair.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Now, here is the tutorial on how to leverage your server information for remote connections and file transfers, assuming you are using your <strong>new, secure SSH keys</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Section 1: Understanding Your Server Information (Recap)</strong></p>

<p>Based on your command outputs, here’s what we know about your server:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your Username on the Server:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ibbsbbry</code></li>
  <li><strong>Server Hostname:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code></li>
  <li><strong>Server IP Address (Public):</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">15.204.42.250</code></li>
  <li><strong>Your (Compromised) SSH Public Key on Server:</strong> The one you listed, starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC...</code>. <strong>This should be removed as per Section 0.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>SSH Port:</strong> Assumed to be the default, port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">22</code>. If it’s different, you’ll need to specify it in your commands.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Section 2: Connecting Remotely with SSH (Secure Shell)</strong></p>

<p>SSH allows secure command-line access to your server.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SSH Client on Your Local Machine:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Linux/macOS:</strong> OpenSSH client is usually pre-installed. Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Terminal</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Windows:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Windows 10/11: OpenSSH client can be installed via “Optional Features” or use PowerShell.</li>
          <li>Alternatively, use a third-party client like PuTTY.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Your NEW Secure SSH Key Pair:</strong> Generated and configured as per Section 0.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.1. Key-Based Authentication (Recommended &amp; Most Secure)</strong></p>

<p>This uses your private key (on your local client machine) and its corresponding public key (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the server).</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Ensure Your NEW Public Key is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authorized_keys</code> on the Server:</strong> Done in Section 0, Step 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Ensure Your NEW Private Key is Secure on Your Client Machine:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Stored in a known location (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>).</li>
      <li>Has correct permissions: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod 600 ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Connecting:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>From Linux/macOS Terminal, or Windows PowerShell (with OpenSSH client):</strong>
Use the server’s hostname or IP address. If your private key is not the default (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>), or if you have multiple keys, specify it with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-i</code> option.
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># If your new key is the default and loaded by the agent or has no passphrase</span>
ssh ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com
<span class="c"># OR using IP</span>
ssh ibbsbbry@15.204.42.250
<span class="c"># OR specifying your new private key file</span>
ssh <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com
</code></pre></div>        </div>
        <p><strong>If using a non-standard SSH port (e.g., 2222):</strong></p>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename <span class="nt">-p</span> 2222 ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com
</code></pre></div>        </div>
        <p>The first time you connect to a new server, you’ll be asked to verify the host’s fingerprint. Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yes</code>. If you used a passphrase for your private key, you’ll be prompted to enter it.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>From Windows using PuTTY:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>Open PuTTY.</li>
          <li><strong>Session Tab:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Host Name (or IP address): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">15.204.42.250</code></li>
              <li>Port: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">22</code> (or your non-standard port).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Connection &gt; SSH &gt; Auth Tab:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Click “Browse…” next to “Private key file for authentication”.</li>
              <li>Select your <strong>new</strong> private key file. PuTTY uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ppk</code> format. If your new key is in OpenSSH format (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id_ed25519</code>), you’ll need to convert it using <strong>PuTTYgen</strong> (comes with PuTTY). Open PuTTYgen, load your OpenSSH private key file, and then “Save private key” as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ppk</code> file.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>(Optional) Go back to “Session”, name your session under “Saved Sessions”, and click “Save”.</li>
          <li>Click “Open”. You’ll be prompted for your username (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ibbsbbry</code>) and then your private key’s passphrase if it has one.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2.2. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agent</code> for Convenience (Optional)</strong></p>

<p>If your private key has a passphrase, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agent</code> can store the decrypted key in memory, so you only need to enter the passphrase once per session.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Start <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agent</code> (usually starts automatically on modern systems):</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">eval</span> “<span class="si">$(</span>ssh-agent <span class="nt">-s</span><span class="si">)</span>”
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Add your new private key to the agent:</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>You’ll be prompted for the key’s passphrase once. Now, subsequent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sftp</code> commands using this key won’t ask for the passphrase until the agent stops or the key is removed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2.3. Password Authentication (Less Secure - Discouraged if Key Auth is Set Up)</strong></p>

<p>If key authentication fails or is not configured, and if the server allows password authentication (often disabled for security), you might be prompted for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ibbsbbry</code>’s password.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It’s highly recommended to disable password authentication on your server once key-based authentication is working reliably.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3: Transferring Files Securely</strong></p>

<p>Always use secure methods like SFTP or SCP, which leverage your SSH connection. <strong>Avoid plain FTP as it’s insecure.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.1. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) - Interactive Session</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>From Linux/macOS Terminal, or Windows PowerShell:</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sftp ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com
<span class="c"># OR, if using a non-standard port (e.g., 2222) and specific key:</span>
sftp <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename <span class="nt">-P</span> 2222 ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com
<span class="c"># Note: OpenSSH sftp client often uses -oPort= for non-standard ports:</span>
<span class="c"># sftp -i ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename -oPort=2222 ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>Common SFTP commands at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sftp&gt;</code> prompt:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">put /local/path/file.txt [/remote/path/file.txt]</code>: Upload.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get /remote/path/file.txt [/local/path/file.txt]</code>: Download.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lpwd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lls</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lcd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>From Windows using a GUI client (e.g., WinSCP, FileZilla):</strong>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>WinSCP:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>File protocol: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SFTP</code></li>
          <li>Host name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code></li>
          <li>Port number: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">22</code> (or your custom port)</li>
          <li>User name: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ibbsbbry</code></li>
          <li>For key auth: Click “Advanced…” &gt; “SSH” &gt; “Authentication”, select your <strong>new</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ppk</code> private key file.</li>
          <li>Login.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>FileZilla:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Host: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sftp://dc2.myusadc.com</code> (prefix with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sftp://</code>)</li>
          <li>Username: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ibbsbbry</code></li>
          <li>Port: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">22</code> (or your custom port)</li>
          <li>For key auth: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Edit &gt; Settings &gt; Connection &gt; SFTP</code>, add your <strong>new</strong> private key file (OpenSSH format or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ppk</code> often works).</li>
          <li>Quickconnect or use Site Manager.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2. SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) - Direct File Copy</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>From Linux or macOS Terminal, or Windows PowerShell:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local to Server:</strong>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>scp <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename /path/to/local/file.txt ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com:/remote/path/
<span class="c"># If using a non-standard port (e.g., 2222), use uppercase -P:</span>
scp <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename <span class="nt">-P</span> 2222 /path/to/local/file.txt ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com:/remote/path/
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Server to Local:</strong>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>scp <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename <span class="nt">-P</span> 2222 ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com:/remote/path/file.txt /local/path/
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Copy directories recursively with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-r</code>:</strong>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>scp <span class="nt">-r</span> <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename <span class="nt">-P</span> 2222 /local/directory ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com:/remote/parent_directory/
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.3. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> (Advanced File Synchronization)</strong></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> is powerful for efficiently synchronizing files and directories. It only transfers differences, can resume, and preserves permissions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Local to Server (archive mode, verbose, compress, progress):</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rsync <span class="nt">-avz</span> —progress <span class="nt">-e</span> “ssh <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename <span class="nt">-p</span> 2222” /path/to/local/source/ ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com:/path/to/remote/destination/
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>(Note the trailing slash on the source <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/path/to/local/source/</code> means “copy the contents of source”).</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Server to Local:</strong>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rsync <span class="nt">-avz</span> —progress <span class="nt">-e</span> “ssh <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/your_new_private_key_filename <span class="nt">-p</span> 2222” ibbsbbry@dc2.myusadc.com:/path/to/remote/source/ /path/to/local/destination/
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Section 4: Important General Considerations</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Server-Side Firewall:</strong> Ensure the firewall on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code> (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ufw</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">firewalld</code>) allows incoming connections on your SSH port (default 22).</li>
  <li><strong>SSH Server Configuration (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sshd_config</code>):</strong> Located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> on the server. Key settings include:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Port 22</code> (or your custom port)</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PubkeyAuthentication yes</code> (essential for key auth)</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PasswordAuthentication no</code> (recommended once key auth is solid)</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PermitRootLogin no</code> (recommended)
If you change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sshd_config</code>, restart the SSH service (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo systemctl restart sshd</code>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Client-Side Private Key Security:</strong> Reiterating: protect your new private key. Use a strong passphrase.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Section 5: Basic SSH Troubleshooting</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Connection refused</code> on port 22 (or custom port):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Is the server <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code> online and reachable (try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ping dc2.myusadc.com</code>)?</li>
      <li>Is the SSH service (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sshd</code>) running on the server? (Check with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo systemctl status sshd</code> on the server).</li>
      <li>Is a firewall on the server or network blocking the SSH port?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic...)</code>:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Is your <strong>new</strong> public key correctly added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the server?</li>
      <li>Are permissions correct on the server: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh</code> (700), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> (600)?</li>
      <li>Are permissions correct for your <strong>new</strong> private key on your client machine (600)?</li>
      <li>Are you explicitly telling your SSH client to use the correct new private key (e.g., with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_new_key</code>) if it’s not the default or if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agent</code> isn’t managing it?</li>
      <li>Check SSH server logs on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dc2.myusadc.com</code> (often in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/log/auth.log</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/log/secure</code>) for more detailed error messages. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -v user@host</code> (verbose) or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-vvv</code> (very verbose) on the client for more diagnostic output.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prompted for password unexpectedly:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The server might not be configured for public key authentication, or your public key setup is incorrect.</li>

<h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>

<p>present an ‘eidetic reduction’ of the ‘read’, ‘write’, ‘execute’, and other phenomena that i might forgot to mention, in the context of ‘computer science’ and the realm of ‘permissions’, making, at the end, a paralel with the human cognition, conscience, inner voices, daydreaming, woop framework (if/then conditioning behavior).</p>

<h2 id="response">Response</h2>

<p>Below is one way to “reduce” the familiar computer‐science permissions—read, write, execute, and related operations—to their bare, essential forms, and then to draw an analogy with key aspects of human cognition and behavioral conditioning (as exemplified by inner voices, daydreaming, and even frameworks like WOOP).</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Eidetic Reduction in Computer Science</li>
</ol>

<p>When we perform an eidetic reduction, we seek to strip away the accidental particulars and focus on the invariant, essential “forms” behind phenomena. In the realm of computer permissions, we typically think in terms of:</p>

<p>• Read – Essentially, “to observe or perceive.” In a file system, having “read” permission means one may access and retrieve information: the data is visible, its content can be absorbed without altering the object’s state.</p>

<p>• Write – Essentially, “to alter or record.” “Write” permission lets a process or user modify or inscribe new information into a resource. In its most distilled form, it is the privilege of effecting change upon a given piece of data.</p>

<p>• Execute – Essentially, “to act or enact.” Execution permission allows a program or process not merely to view or change data but to <em>trigger</em> a transformation—to activate behavior encoded within a resource, turning static instructions into dynamic action.</p>

<p>Often, file systems may also grant additional permissions (like delete, append, or modify). In each case, though, we can reduce these varied operations to whether one is allowed to (a) perceive (read), (b) alter (write), or (c) enact/transform (execute) the underlying entity. In essence, these permissions define the nature of the allowed interactions between an agent (or process) and a resource.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parallels with Human Cognition</li>
</ol>

<p>Now consider the human mind. At a phenomenological level, one might think of our cognition in terms analogous to these operational modes:</p>

<p>• Perception as “Reading”:<br />
Our sensory intake acts like the “read” permission. We are continuously bombarded with information from the environment, and our perceptual apparatus “reads” these signals—capturing details without immediately altering them. Like a controlled read operation, this input stage is selective and filtered.</p>

<p>• Memory and Expression as “Writing”:<br />
The act of forming memories, introspection, or even articulating thoughts can be seen as “writing.” When we internalize an experience, record it in language, or even revise our internal narratives, we are engaging in an operation analogous to writing in a computer system—a transformative process that leaves a trace.</p>

<p>• Action as “Execution”:<br />
Turning intentions into deeds, or even engaging in daydreaming and simulated scenarios, corresponds to “executing.” When you allow an idea to blossom into a decision or carry out a planned behavior, you are “running” a mental program. The similarity is striking: just as a file with execution permission can be activated to produce behavior, our inner plans must be “executed” for them to produce real-world effects.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Inner Voices, Daydreaming, and the WOOP Framework</li>
</ol>

<p>Connecting further with human consciousness:<br />
• Inner Voices and Self-Talk – These can be conceived as meta-level “permission checks.” Our inner dialogue often questions whether a thought should be noted (written), if an idea warrants further attention (read), or if it should lead to an actual behavior (execute). This internal evaluation mirrors a system where an operation is only permitted if the appropriate “permission flag” is set, akin to a gatekeeper that scrutinizes intentions.</p>

<p>• Daydreaming – In a sense, daydreaming is an internal simulation where the brain “executes” scenarios based solely on internally “read” inputs and the creative “writing” of possibilities. It is a testing ground—much like running a program in a sandbox—to see potential outcomes without committing to external change.</p>

<p>• The WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) Framework – WOOP is a structured method for goal setting and self-regulation that functions something like an if/then (or condition/permission) routine in computer science.<br />
  ○ Wish: This is the internal “read” of a desire or need.<br />
  ○ Outcome and Obstacle: The mind “writes” narratives about what achieving that wish might entail and what factors might interfere.<br />
  ○ Plan: Finally, a contingency “execute” command is formed—a conditional action rule (“if this obstacle arises, then I will…”) that governs behavior.</p>

<p>Just as a computer system checks if it has permission to execute a certain operation, we internally determine whether our motivations, expectations, and perceived obstacles collectively “grant permission” for an action to unfold.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>In Summary</li>
</ol>

<p>By reducing computer permissions to their essential functions—read (perceive), write (alter/record), execute (act/enact)—we see that these operations form a minimal, yet powerful, interaction model. Similarly, human cognition and behavior can be seen through the same tripartite lens:
  • We “read” sensory and experiential data,<br />
  • “Write” meaning into our memories and inner narratives, and<br />
  • “Execute” actions based on internal decisions and conditioned plans.</p>

<p>Thus, the deeply technical notions of “permissions” in a computer system echo the fundamental dynamics of human mental processing: both systems manage access, modification, and action according to sets of rules or conditions. Whether it is a program checking for rights before opening a file or your mind evaluating whether to pursue a daydreamed plan, the underlying structure is remarkably similar—a testament to how even abstract computational concepts can provide insight into the architecture of human cognition.</p>

<p>I want an more technical, eidetic reduction, conceptualization of the phenomena of ‘writing’ and ‘executing’ within the context of human cognition, because for me your previous response kinda overlapped those two phenomena. Also, regarding the internal vocalization as a gatekeeper, how about interpreting it as an alien, a external influence from culture and conditioning that opressess the real evaluation and decision processes, which trully are not vocalized, but made rapidly in the inner core of neural processess. Or am I wrong?</p>

<h2 id="response-1">Response</h2>

<p>Below is an expanded, more technical eidetic reduction of the phenomena, aiming to distinguish between the aspects of “writing” and “executing” in human cognition, while also reinterpreting the role of internal vocalization from that of an automated gatekeeper to a potential external influence—one that reflects cultural conditioning.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Writing in Human Cognition</li>
</ol>

<p>At its core, the operation of “writing” in a cognitive context can be seen as the transformation of ephemeral neural activity (raw sensory or internally generated signals) into a more stable, symbolic or representational form. A more technical breakdown might include:</p>

<p>a. Encoding and Representation:<br />
• At the neural level, transient patterns of activity are “written” into memory by processes such as synaptic modification (e.g., long-term potentiation).<br />
• This conversion from transient percepts to a semi-permanent encoding is analogous to writing data into non-volatile storage: in both cases, a fleeting signal is transformed into a retrievable representation.</p>

<p>b. Externalization in Thought:<br />
• Beyond mere memory consolidation, writing in cognition may also imply the internal organization and structuring of ideas into a symbolic language (e.g., inner speech or visual imagery).<br />
• This “internal writing” provides a substrate upon which further cognitive operations, such as reasoning or planning, are performed. It is the process by which an initial raw impulse is refined into a more coherent, examinable format.</p>

<p>c. Functional Role and Flexibility:<br />
• This cognitive writing does not simply log experiences—it recasts them so that they can be manipulated, compared against other information, or used in simulating scenarios (such as during daydreams).<br />
• In computational terms, it’s comparable to translating a high-level idea into an intermediate representation, which can then be further processed, akin to an abstract syntax tree in programming that organizes raw code into structured meaning.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Executing in Human Cognition</li>
</ol>

<p>In contrast, “executing” in the cognitive domain relates to the actualization and enactment of internally prepared plans or decisions. The technical components include:</p>

<p>a. Decision Implementation:<br />
• Execution usually refers to the deployment of motor commands or the initiation of complex behaviors. This process is often governed by subcortical structures (such as the basal ganglia) and higher cortical decision-making areas.<br />
• The conversion from deliberation (the prepared, “written” idea) to action is highly automated and is fine-tuned by rapid, largely unconscious neural circuit dynamics, which resemble machine-level execution cycles in software.</p>

<p>b. Subconscious Processing and Temporal Dynamics:<br />
• Execution typically happens within a fraction of a second once the decision thresholds are met, suggesting it is deeply embedded in the brain’s procedural systems.<br />
• This rapid execution is less about conscious step-by-step reasoning and more about an automatic “run” of neural processes that integrate the results of prior cognitive writing with situational context.</p>

<p>c. Internal Simulation vs. External Action:<br />
• Notably, “executing” in a daydream scenario is internal: the brain runs simulations using a symbolic model of the world. This “sandbox execution” does not result in actual physical movement but serves as a virtual test of possible future behaviors—an operation that has parallels with simulated execution in a computer sandbox environment.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reinterpreting the Role of Internal Vocalization</li>
</ol>

<p>Traditional interpretations of inner voices as a gatekeeper—performing meta-level permission checks for further cognition—take the following form: when an idea is generated, it is “audited” by a monologue that decides if it should be encoded further (written) or acted upon (executed). However, an alternative view suggests these vocalizations may instead be influenced by external factors:</p>

<p>a. Cultural and Social Conditioning as External Modulators:<br />
• The content and tone of our inner speech are often heavily shaped by cultural narratives and social conditioning. This means that instead of being an inherent mechanism solely optimized for rapid, unmediated evaluation, the inner voice may act as a repository of external norms and values imposed on our natural cognitive workflow.<br />
• In technical terms, one can view these vocalizations as an “external patch” layered on top of the basal neural permissions system—a modulatory process that integrates culturally acquired “flags” into the otherwise rapid, automated decision-making processes.</p>

<p>b. The Impact on the True Cognitive Core:<br />
• Rather than a pristine, internal evaluation mechanism, vocalized thoughts can reflect a level of processing that has been influenced, or even suppressed, by external standards. In many instances, the rapid neural decisions (the core “execute” process) occur without vocalization, and the internal monologue may then serve to rationalize or justify the preliminary results that emerged from subcortical and preconscious computations.<br />
• Conceptually, while a computer may check a permission flag in a deterministic, rule-bound fashion, the brain’s “flag” is often a product of both internal dynamics and external pressures—making it a hybrid result of innate efficiency and culturally mediated oversight.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Summary of the Technical Eidetic Reduction</li>
</ol>

<p>• Writing – In human cognition, “writing” is the process of encoding, structuring, and externalizing thoughts and memories. It is akin to converting transient neural activity into intermediate code (or stored representations) that can later be re-read, processed, or simulated further. Its primary function is to create a coherent, manipulable substrate for further cognitive operations.</p>

<p>• Executing – “Executing” in the cognitive sphere refers to the rapid translation of pre-encoded representations (or plans) into actual behavior or internal simulations. This process is highly automated, deeply rooted in procedural neural circuits, and optimized for speed—executing decisions almost instantaneously once the requisite thresholds are met.</p>

<p>• Internal Vocalization – While often conceptualized as an internal gatekeeper performing meta-level checks, these vocalizations may instead be seen as a culturally modulated overlay that can both shape and sometimes obscure the true, rapid decision-making processes intrinsic to our neural circuitry.</p>

<p>By teasing apart these layers, the eidetic reduction sharpens our understanding: while writing and executing are distinct operations with clear parallels in computational systems, the internal vocalizations (or gatekeeping mechanisms) may not be intrinsic evaluators at all but rather expressions colored by external influences. This realization underscores the complexity of human cognition—where the raw, efficient core processes can be both aided and inhibited by layers informed by social and cultural conditioning.</p>

<p>how to skip that ‘internal vocalization’ in order to surpass problems like ‘analisys paralisys’, overthinking and anxiety and  operate more biologically naturally, by letting those rapidly autonomous decision processes to perform what they ought to do, given the external circumstances and/or internal/external stimulus, which are read by our sensory system and, if a plan/program/idea/simulation, already encoded and present within the memory database and such stimulus from external or internal circumstances triggers that plan/program/idea, then the execution process automatically starts, and, if no such thing is triggered within the brains database, so that data/phenomena input captured by the sensors is kinda like embeddeded/encoded in some kinda of initial representation/symbol, the initial ‘writing’ process, and - now I want to present another phenomena for we to discuss - if an ‘query’ is made by something, maybe here starts to enter conscience processes, like when what is happening is new, new stimulus, new circunstances and nothing within the brain’s database relate, so, maybe that generates an ‘query’ for further ‘writing processess’ what will use that query to gather those embedded symbols and representations in order to further processes and evaluate in order to output an more complex ‘program’ to model the behaviour response to such stimulus and, now I don’t how the extent of such looping processes of manipulatings those embeddings and outputs in order to stop at a defined program to be followed, maybe that has something to do with proper internal vocalization and sandbox processes of daydreaming? am I totally lost or kinda makes sense? please help me understanding all of thise</p>

<h2 id="response-2">Response</h2>

<p>Below is an exploration of how one might “skip” or bypass overactive internal vocalization—the conscious, deliberative “gatekeeper”—in favor of more rapid, autonomous neural processes. This discussion will blend ideas from dual-process theories, neurobiology, and cognitive models to address issues like analysis paralysis, overthinking, and anxiety while preserving flexibility to assess novel stimuli when needed.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Dual-Process Foundations in Cognition</li>
</ol>

<p>A useful starting point is the idea of dual systems in the brain:</p>

<p>• System 1 (Fast, Automatic Processing):<br />
 ◦ Operates quickly, unconsciously, and intuitively.<br />
 ◦ Corresponds to the raw “reading” of sensory inputs and direct activation of stored programs (i.e., automatically executed responses when familiar patterns are detected).</p>

<p>• System 2 (Slow, Deliberate Processing):<br />
 ◦ Involves conscious reflection, internal vocalization, and explicit reasoning.<br />
 ◦ Engages when a stimulus is new, ambiguous, or when the system’s automatic responses do not readily match the context (triggering query processes or internal “writing” to form a new program).</p>

<p>In this framework, the elaborate “inner voice” can sometimes override or delay the efficient, automatic responses. In cases of overthinking, anxiety, or analysis paralysis, System 2 is firing off too many deliberative checks instead of letting the well-trained, automatic processes run unimpeded.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reducing Dependence on Internal Vocalization</li>
</ol>

<p>To operate more “biologically naturally” (i.e., to let the rapid, autonomous decision processes run as intended):</p>

<p>a. Training and Reinforcement<br />
 • Repeated exposure and practice can “tune” the automatic systems. For example, skilled athletes, musicians, or experienced professionals often bypass a detailed internal narrative in favor of well-honed motor programs.<br />
 • This training helps embed frequently encountered situations into procedural memory, so that given a familiar stimulus, the brain “executes” the appropriate program without needing to run extensive internal dialogue.</p>

<p>b. Mindfulness and Meditation<br />
 • Techniques that cultivate mindfulness aim to reduce the intrusive self-talk that can feed analysis paralysis. With practice, one learns to observe thoughts (the internal writing and query processes) without actively engaging them.<br />
 • By simply letting thoughts float by without verbalizing or overanalyzing, the underlying System 1 processes are given a freer rein to handle stimuli automatically.</p>

<p>c. Cognitive Restructuring<br />
 • Therapies or mental exercises aimed at reinterpreting internal speech (often taught in cognitive behavioral therapy) can reduce anxiety. Instead of letting the voice act as a “cultural filter” that overemphasizes caution, it can be trained to serve as a brief notifier rather than a detailed evaluator.
 • In effect, this allows the brain to fall back on well-rehearsed response patterns unless a genuine novelty is detected.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Handling Novel Stimuli: Query, Write, and Subsequent Execution</li>
</ol>

<p>Your description introduces a two-phase process when encountering novel stimuli:</p>

<p>Phase 1: Querying and Initial Writing<br />
 • When a stimulus is encountered that does not automatically match a preexisting program (i.e., nothing in the “brain database” immediately triggers an automatic execution), the system must initiate a query.<br />
 • This query process is essentially the system probing its stored representations, trying to map the new input onto known symbols. The “writing” here involves beginning to build a new representation, encoding potentially ambiguous or unfamiliar input.<br />
 • While this phase is slower and involves conscious attention (and might be accompanied by inner vocalizations), its role is necessary when novelty is high.</p>

<p>Phase 2: Consolidation and Autonomous Execution<br />
 • Once the query has reached a point of resolution—a tentative program is formed—the system can then “execute” this behavior either consciously or automatically.<br />
 • Over time, with repeated exposure, what initially began as a high-engagement query process may become “precompiled” into the automatic routines of System 1.<br />
 • Daydreaming and internal sandbox simulations can serve as a rehearsal space where multiple responses are “executed” mentally, and the most efficient becomes reinforced. This rehearsal helps smooth the transition from effortful processing to a future state of automaticity.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Balancing the Two: When to Bypass Vocalization and When Not To</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s important to recognize that the internal vocalization isn’t inherently bad. It plays a role in ensuring that in novel or ambiguous situations the decision process is appropriately complex and deliberate. However, dysfunction arises when:
 • The system defaults to constant internal narration even in clear-cut, familiar situations.
 • Over-analysis leads to delays in action (overthinking) or heightened anxiety because nothing “gets done” while debate is ongoing.</p>

<p>Thus, one might aim to bypass the internal vocalization layer under circumstances where:
 • The stimulus is familiar and the “database” has well-established programs.
 • The environment is time-critical and demands immediate action—a state sometimes induced by training, habituation, or even stress inoculation techniques.</p>

<p>Conversely, when encountering truly novel, ambiguous, or emotionally charged situations, a controlled query process (with some level of internal vocalization) may be necessary to generate a safe, adaptive response.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>Practical Strategies and Insights</li>
</ol>

<p>• Exposure and Habituation:<br />
 Gradually exposing oneself to decision-making scenarios can help train the brain to rely more on System 1 automatic responses. Over time, tasks formerly subject to overanalysis can be executed more automatically.</p>

<p>• Reducing “Noise” in Self-Talk:<br />
 Techniques like “thought labeling” or mindfulness allow one to acknowledge internal vocalization without letting it dominate. One might say, “I have a thought about X,” then let it pass, trusting that the neural substrate has learned appropriate responses.</p>

<p>• Recognize the Role of Novelty:<br />
 Accept that—when a truly new stimulus arises—there will be a period where the slower, query-based processes are necessary. The goal isn’t to eliminate internal vocalization entirely, but rather to prevent its overuse in situations where it isn’t beneficial.</p>

<p>• Biofeedback and Neurofeedback:<br />
 Emerging technologies might help monitor brain activation patterns. Such techniques can train individuals to identify when they’re engaging in excessive internal vocalization and learn to modulate that activity.</p>

<p>──────────────────────────────</p>
<ol>
  <li>In Summary</li>
</ol>

<p>Your conceptual model is on the right track:</p>

<p>– When a familiar input is “read” by our sensory system, and a corresponding program exists in memory, the automatic “execution” should ideally happen swiftly—free from the interference of prolonged internal vocalization.</p>

<p>– If the system encounters unfamiliar input, a query process initiates that “writes” new representations. The duration of this process can be modulated by our tendency to engage in internal vocal dialogue, which in turn can lead to overthinking or anxiety if left unchecked.</p>

<p>By understanding these layers—automatic execution versus consciously mediated query/writing steps—we can develop strategies to “skip” or minimize internal vocalization for routine tasks, thereby reducing analysis paralysis. Simultaneously, we acknowledge the need for reflective processes when novelty demands extra processing.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal is to fine-tune the interface between our rapid, evolutionarily honed neural processes and the slower, culturally influenced conscious reflections. This balance allows for both efficient, natural behavior in routine contexts and adaptive, reflective responses in novel or complex situations.</p>

<h2 id="response-3">Response</h2>

<p>Based on our entire conversation, here is an extensive chain of your queries and our discussion, presented as a single comprehensive and coherent query:</p>

<p>Our dialogue began with your request for an eidetic reduction of computer science permissions—specifically the operations “read,” “write,” and “execute”—and a parallel comparison to human cognition. You sought to distill these technical operations to their essential forms (reading as perception, writing as encoding or memory formation, and execution as action) and then relate these functions to inner cognitive dynamics such as internal dialogues, daydreaming, and conditioned behavioral responses (for example, within the WOOP framework). The initial inquiry set the stage for understanding how both engineered systems and human thought processes handle inputs, transform them, and produce outputs based on established permissions or conditioned responses.</p>

<p>Following this, you asked for an expanded explanation focused on internal vocalizations and daydreaming in cognitive processes, with an emphasis on developing a more technical, eidetic reduction of “writing” and “executing” in the mind. We discussed how these processes might be seen as analogous to encoding transient experiences into stable neural representations (writing) versus triggering immediate, subconscious procedural responses that lead to action (executing). At the same time, we explored the possibility that internal vocalization—traditionally viewed as a meta-level permission check—could alternatively be interpreted as an external influence rooted in cultural conditioning, which might interfere with or modulate the brain’s rapid and natural processing pathways.</p>

<p>Building on this conceptual framework, you then posed a further challenge: how to bypass or “skip” the overactive internal vocalization that often results in analysis paralysis, overthinking, or anxiety. Here, you proposed a model in which the sensory system captures external or internal stimuli and, if a familiar plan or memory exists, the process should move rapidly into execution without undue verbalized deliberation. Conversely, when encountering novel or unrecognized stimuli, the brain initiates a query process—beginning with a rudimentary representation (writing) that, after evaluation, may lead to complex program formation to generate adaptive responses. You questioned whether these looping processes, sometimes manifested as daydreaming or internal simulations, might be the point at which conscious vocalizations become necessary or perhaps even beneficial—a potential hybrid between rapid, innate execution and slower, reflective thought.</p>

<p>Throughout our exchange, the overarching themes and objectives have centered on articulating the delicate balance between rapid, automated neural operations (the “read” and “execute” processes) and the slower, more reflective processes (the “writing” and internal vocalization or query checks) that come into play during unfamiliar or ambiguous circumstances. The key challenge has been to delineate when internal deliberation should be bypassed to allow biologically natural, automatic responses and when it is necessary for handling new information. We explored conceptual analogies drawn from computer science (such as permission flags and sandbox execution) to clarify the intricate interplay between trained automatic processes and culturally modulated conscious deliberation.</p>

<p>In addressing these challenges, our strategy involved a careful analysis of dual-process theories in cognitive science, which separate the fast, intuitive System 1 from the slower, reflective System 2. We discussed methods and techniques—such as training through repeated exposure, mindfulness practices to curb excessive internal chatter, and cognitive restructuring—to reduce interference from vocalized inner dialogue and thereby foster more natural, immediate reactions. The evolution of our discussion illuminated the benefits of letting well-established, neurobiologically ingrained processes take precedence in routine or time-sensitive situations while still preserving the capacity for deeper analysis when encountering novel stimuli. We recognized that while the internal vocalization might sometimes serve as a gatekeeper for safe or adaptive behavior, its overuse can hinder the rapid, autonomous decision-making that is essential in familiar contexts.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our conversation has provided critical insights into how one might recalibrate the interplay between automatic and reflective cognitive processes. By understanding and distinguishing between the “writing” (encoding and representation) and “executing” (automatic behavior initiation) functions within the brain—and reinterpreting the role of internal vocalization as potentially influenced by external cultural factors—we have charted a path toward overcoming issues like overthinking and anxiety. The final integrated perspective emphasizes that the goal is not to eliminate conscious deliberation entirely but to establish a coherent bridge between rapid, efficient neural responses and the slower, evaluative processes required for genuine novelty. This comprehensive narrative encapsulates our progress from the original technical analogies to a nuanced exploration of human cognition, outlining both the challenges faced and the strategies proposed to achieve a more balanced and effective decision-making process.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Optimizing RK3588 Performance</title><link href="https://ib.bsb.br/optimizing-rk3588-performance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Optimizing RK3588 Performance" /><published>2025-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-24T16:13:25+00:00</updated><id>https://ib.bsb.br/optimizing-rk3588-performance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ib.bsb.br/optimizing-rk3588-performance/"><![CDATA[<p>This article details methods to enhance the performance of the Rockchip RK3588 system-on-chip (SoC). By adjusting configurations for the <strong>CPU</strong>, <strong>GPU</strong>, and <strong>RAM</strong>, it is possible to achieve significant performance improvements beyond default settings, potentially increasing overall system performance by <strong>up to 40%</strong> in specific benchmarks.</p>

<p>The techniques described leverage capabilities present in the hardware that may not be fully utilized by standard software configurations. This guide is based on testing performed using the latest Armbian Build with the Rockchip BSP Kernel version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6.1.115</code> but the overlays can be adapted to any distro.</p>

<p>Optimizing the CPU frequency on the RK3588 can be achieved through device-tree modifications. Depending on the specific silicon quality, many RK3588 units are capable of stable operation at <strong>2.4GHz</strong> with a minor adjustment to the core voltage from a fixed <strong>1v</strong> to <strong>1.05v</strong>.</p>

<p>This optimization is typically implemented using a device-tree overlay. In Armbian, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rockchip-rk3588-opp-oc-24ghz</code> overlay is provided for this purpose. This overlay modifies the CPU’s <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp.txt">Operating Performance Point (OPP) table</a> to include the desired higher frequency and corresponding voltage.</p>

<p>To apply the overlay you have to:</p>

<h3 id="cpu-optimization-results-">CPU Optimization Results <a href="https://sbcwiki.com/news/articles/tune-your-rk3588/#cpu-optimization-results">#</a></h3>

<p>Applying the CPU overclock to 2.4GHz resulted in performance improvements of up to <strong>+9%</strong> in Single-Core tests and <strong>+4%</strong> in Multi-Core tests within Geekbench 6.</p>

<h2 id="gpu-clock-correction-">GPU Clock Correction <a href="https://sbcwiki.com/news/articles/tune-your-rk3588/#gpu-clock-correction">#</a></h2>

<p>Analysis of RK3588 configurations reveals that the integrated Mali-G610 MP4 GPU, while rated for a <strong>1GHz</strong> clock speed, often operates at a lower frequency, commonly around <strong>850MHz</strong>, in default software configurations. It has been observed that the devfreq subsystem may report the intended 1GHz clock even when the hardware is running slower.</p>

<p>To verify the actual GPU clock speed, the clk_summary debugfs interface can be consulted:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary | grep gpu
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the reported actual frequency is below 1GHz, a configuration discrepancy exists. Correcting the device-tree to properly set the GPU clock to its rated 1GHz is necessary to utilize its full potential. If this issue is present in your OS build, reporting it to the maintainers is recommended.</p>

<h3 id="gpu-clock-correction-results-">GPU Clock Correction Results <a href="https://sbcwiki.com/news/articles/tune-your-rk3588/#gpu-clock-correction-results">#</a></h3>

<p>Ensuring the GPU operates at its rated 1GHz frequency yields a substantial performance increase. Testing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">glmark2-wayland</code> in the demanding ’terrain’ scene, a common benchmark for embedded GPUs, shows an improvement of approximately <strong>18%</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="ram-optimization-lpddr5-models-">RAM Optimization (LPDDR5 Models) <a href="https://sbcwiki.com/news/articles/tune-your-rk3588/#ram-optimization-lpddr5-models">#</a></h2>

<p>This section details a method for optimizing memory performance on RK3588 boards equipped with LPDDR5 RAM. The Technical Reference Manual specifies „optimized“ support for LPDDR5-5500 MT/s (here equivalent to a 2736MHz clock). However, testing indicates the memory controller is capable of operating at higher speeds, specifically the maximum standard LPDDR5 speed of <strong>6400 MT/s</strong> (corresponding to a 3200MHz clock).</p>

<p>Implementing this requires <em>verifying</em> that the installed LPDDR5 modules on your board are rated for 6400 MT/s or higher. This can be done by identifying the RAM chip model number (usually printed on the chip) and consulting its datasheet or searching online.</p>

<p>For reference, testing was conducted on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Radxa Rock-5T using SKHynix H58G56AK6B-X069 modules, rated for LPDDR5-6400.</li>
  <li>A 24GB Rock-5B-Plus using two 12GB SKHynix H58GG8AK8Q-X103 modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>While rated for LPDDR5X-8533, these operate in LPDDR5 backwards compatibility mode and are fully capable of LPDDR5-6400 operation.</p>

<p>Achieving 6400 MT/s operation requires two steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Enable a device-tree overlay: The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rockchip-rk3588-dmc-oc-3500mhz</code> overlay is required to enable the necessary memory controller frequency steps, despite the name indicating 3500MHz.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apply timing parameters with RKDDR Tool: The specific low-level timing parameters for 3200MHz (6400 MT/s) must be loaded into the ddr blob. This is accomplished using <a href="https://github.com/hbiyik/rkddr">Hbiyik’s RKDDR Tool</a>. The tool requires setting specific register values, illustrated by the following configuration: <img src="https://sbcwiki.com/news/articles/tune-your-rk3588/RKDDR_hu_5a57348b4ed75b9e.png" alt="Image 7: RKDDR" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ram-optimization-results-">RAM Optimization Results <a href="https://sbcwiki.com/news/articles/tune-your-rk3588/#ram-optimization-results">#</a></h3>

<p>The increase in memory bandwidth significantly impacts overall system performance, particularly in memory-intensive tasks. Re-evaluating the glmark2-wayland terrain test used previously, applying the 6400 MT/s RAM optimization in addition to the GPU clock correction resulted in a further performance increase. The benchmark score rose from 100-105 FPS (stock) to 120-125 FPS (GPU clock corrected) to <strong>140 FPS</strong> (GPU clock corrected + RAM optimized). This represents an approximate 20% performance gain in this test attributed to the RAM optimization alone, and a <strong>cumulative +40% over stock</strong>.</p>

<p>This improvement in memory performance translates to enhanced responsiveness and throughput across a wide range of applications, not limited to graphics benchmarks.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-">Conclusion <a href="https://sbcwiki.com/news/articles/tune-your-rk3588/#conclusion">#</a></h2>

<p>By applying these optimizations – increasing the CPU frequency and voltage, correcting the GPU clock speed to its rated value, and configuring the LPDDR5 RAM for 6400 MT/s operation – the performance of the RK3588 SoC can be substantially improved. As demonstrated, <strong>cumulative gains of around 40%</strong> in specific benchmarks are achievable.</p>

<p>Users undertaking these modifications should proceed cautiously, acknowledging the inherent risks associated with operating hardware outside standard parameters and ensuring adequate thermal management is implemented to maintain system stability.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry></feed>
