This report aims to delve into these underutilized capabilities, providing detailed explanations and actionable insights for intermediate to advanced Google Workspace users seeking to further optimize their daily routines. Building upon the foundational examples of quick document creation, basic keyboard shortcuts, and simple macros, this exploration will uncover the hidden potential within the Google Workspace ecosystem, empowering users to work smarter and achieve more.</p>

<p><strong>II. Uncommon Navigation: Exploring Less Known Google Chrome URL Shortcuts for Workspace Apps</strong></p>

<p>Beyond the widely recognized shortcuts sheets.new and docs.new for quickly creating new Google Sheets and Docs, the Google Workspace ecosystem offers a collection of similar, yet less popular, URL shortcuts designed to expedite access to other applications. These shortcuts, when typed directly into the Chrome browser’s address bar, bypass the traditional navigation routes, offering a direct and efficient way to initiate new tasks within the suite.1</p>

<p>For users looking to swiftly schedule an event, typing cal.new or calendar.new into the browser instantly opens a new Google Calendar event creation window.1 This eliminates the need to first navigate to the Google Calendar interface and then click the “Create” button, providing a more direct path to scheduling. Similarly, for those who frequently start their work sessions in Google Drive, the shortcut drive.new quickly launches the file management platform in a new tab.1 While this doesn’t create a new file immediately, it offers a faster entry point to access and organize existing documents.</p>

<p>The creation of new content in other Workspace applications is also streamlined through these URL shortcuts. Typing form.new or forms.new directly opens a new, blank Google Form, ready for customization.1 This is particularly useful for users who frequently need to create surveys or quizzes without the initial step of browsing through templates. For presentations, slide.new or slides.new provides immediate access to a new Google Slides presentation, allowing users to begin outlining ideas or designing slides without delay.1</p>

<p>Communication and collaboration are also enhanced. The shortcut meet.new or meeting.new instantly starts a new Google Meet meeting.1 This feature is invaluable for initiating impromptu video calls or ad-hoc meetings without the need to schedule through Calendar or navigate to the Meet interface. For quick note-taking and idea capture, keep.new opens a new Google Keep note, ready for jotting down thoughts or creating lists.1 This rapid access is ideal for capturing fleeting ideas before they are lost.</p>

<p>Furthermore, these URL shortcuts extend to other creation-based applications within the suite. Typing site.new or sites.new allows users to quickly start building a new Google Site, whether for project collaboration or information sharing.1 For visual tasks, drawing.new opens a new Google Drawing, providing immediate access to tools for creating diagrams and graphics.1 Developers who frequently work with Google Apps Script can benefit from script.new, which directly opens the script editor, bypassing the need to access it through a specific document or sheet.1 Lastly, for teams that utilize Jamboard for visual collaboration and brainstorming, jam.new offers a swift way to start a new session.1</p>

<p>The consistent .new suffix across these shortcuts establishes a recognizable pattern, making it easier for users to remember and utilize them across various Google Workspace applications. This uniformity simplifies the learning process and encourages wider adoption of these time-saving navigation techniques. It is worth noting that while some plural variations of these shortcuts might seem intuitive, such as documents.new, the officially supported and most reliable forms typically use the singular application name, like doc.new.2 For organizations seeking to further streamline access and enhance branding, Google Workspace also allows administrators to set up custom URLs for core applications, such as mail.yourdomain.com or calendar.yourdomain.com.3 While this requires administrative configuration, it can significantly improve user experience with easier-to-remember web addresses.</p>

<p><strong>III. Beyond Formatting: Unveiling Advanced Keyboard Shortcuts in Docs, Sheets, and Slides</strong></p>

<p>While basic keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+C for copy and Ctrl+V for paste are fundamental to productivity, Google Workspace applications offer a plethora of advanced and less obvious shortcuts that can significantly expedite workflows, allowing users to perform complex actions without relying on mouse navigation.7</p>

<p>In Google Docs, beyond basic text formatting, several shortcuts enhance navigation and collaboration. For navigating long documents, Ctrl + Alt + n followed by a heading level number (1-6) on Windows/Chrome OS (or Cmd + Option + n then the number on Mac) jumps to the next heading of that specific level, while p replaces n to navigate to the previous heading.8 Similarly, users can quickly move between graphics by using g instead of the heading number, lists with o, and links with l.8 For seamless integration with other Workspace tools, Ctrl + Alt +. or , on Windows/Chrome OS (or Cmd + Option +. or , on Mac) toggles the side panel, providing instant access to Keep, Calendar, and Tasks.8 When working with links or images, Ctrl + Alt + e then p (or Cmd + Option + e then p on Mac) focuses on any open popup windows related to these elements.8 To interact with the broader Google Docs interface without losing focus on the editing area, Ctrl + Alt + Shift + m (or Cmd + Option + Shift + m on Mac) shifts focus away from the document content.8</p>

<p>For text manipulation, Ctrl + Shift + v (or Cmd + Shift + v on Mac) pastes text without formatting, ensuring document consistency.7 Formatting can be efficiently copied using Ctrl + Alt + c (or Cmd + Option + c on Mac) and pasted with Ctrl + Alt + v (or Cmd + Option + v on Mac).7 Rearranging content is made easier with Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down arrow on both Windows/Chrome OS and Mac, allowing for quick paragraph reordering.7 While true non-contiguous text selection for simultaneous editing with a single keyboard action might not be natively supported, users can select multiple sections using the mouse while holding Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac).11 For collaborative workflows, Ctrl + Alt + Shift + a (or Cmd + Option + Shift + a on Mac) instantly opens the comment history.7 When a comment is selected, single-key shortcuts like R for Reply, J for Next, K for Previous, E for Resolve, and U for Exit streamline comment management.7 Other productivity enhancements include the tool finder (Alt + / or Alt + Shift + z on Windows/Chrome OS, Option + / or Ctrl + Option + z on Mac, or Alt + z on Chrome OS) for quickly accessing any menu command 7, repeating the last action with Ctrl + y (or Cmd + y on Mac) 7, and swiftly switching between editing, suggesting, and viewing modes using Ctrl + Alt + Shift + z/x/c (or Cmd + Option + Shift + z/x/c on Mac).7 Direct access to headers and footers is provided by Ctrl + Alt + o then h/f (or Ctrl + Cmd + o then h/f on Mac) 8, and checkboxes can be quickly toggled with Ctrl + Alt + Enter (or Command + Option + Enter on Mac).8</p>

<p>Google Sheets offers a similarly rich set of advanced keyboard shortcuts. For navigation in large spreadsheets, Ctrl + End on Windows (or Fn + Cmd + Right Arrow on Mac) jumps to the last cell containing data.15 Users can scroll by screen using Page Down/Up (or Fn + Down/Up Arrow on Mac).15 Managing grouped data is efficient with Alt + Shift + Arrow Keys (or Cmd + Shift + K on Mac) for expanding and collapsing grouped rows or columns.15 Navigating between multiple sheets is quick with Ctrl + Page Down/Up (or Fn + Cmd + Down/Up Arrow on Mac) 15, and Alt + Shift + K (or Option + Shift + K on Mac) displays a list of all sheets for easy access.10 For data entry, Ctrl + Shift + V (or Cmd + Shift + V on Mac) pastes only the values, excluding formulas or formatting.10 Timestamps can be quickly inserted using Ctrl + Shift + ; and Ctrl + Alt + Shift + ; on Windows (or Cmd + Shift + ; and Cmd + Option + Shift + ; on Mac).10 Number formatting is streamlined with Ctrl + Shift + 1-6 applying decimal, time, date, currency, percentage, and exponent formats respectively.10 Managing cell borders is efficient with Alt + Shift + 1-7 (or Option + Shift + 1-7 on Mac) 10, and Ctrl + \ (or Cmd + \ on Mac) clears all formatting.10 Locking cell references in formulas is done quickly with F4 on Windows (or Fn + F4 on Mac).16 For selection and editing, Shift + Space selects the entire row, and Ctrl + Space (or Cmd + Space on Mac) selects the entire column.10 Rows and columns can be inserted or deleted using Ctrl + Shift + +/- (or Cmd + Shift + +/- on Mac) 10, and data or formulas can be quickly populated down or right using Ctrl + D / Ctrl + R (or Cmd + D / Cmd + R on Mac).10</p>

<p>Google Slides also offers a range of advanced shortcuts. For navigation, Home/End on Windows (or Fn + Left/Right Arrow on Mac) jumps to the first or last slide.19 Slides can be reordered efficiently with Ctrl + Up/Down Arrow on Windows (or Cmd + Up/Down Arrow on Mac).19 Different interface areas like the filmstrip, canvas, and speaker notes can be quickly accessed with Ctrl + Alt + Shift + f/c/s on Windows (or Cmd + Option + Shift + f/c/s on Mac).19 For editing, slides or objects can be duplicated with Ctrl + d on Windows (or Cmd + d on Mac) 19, and formatting can be copied and pasted using Ctrl + Alt + c/v (or Cmd + Option + c/v on Mac).19 Collaboration is enhanced with the ability to insert comments using Ctrl + Alt + m on Windows (or Cmd + Option + m on Mac).19 Presentations can be started from the current slide using Ctrl + Enter on Windows (or Cmd + Return on Mac).19 Precise object placement is possible with nudging using the arrow keys for small increments and Shift + Arrow keys for single-pixel movements.19 Multiple objects can be managed as a single unit by grouping them with Ctrl + Alt + g (or Cmd + Option + g on Mac) and ungrouping with Ctrl + Alt + Shift + g (or Cmd + Option + Shift + g on Mac).19</p>

<p><strong>IV. Powering Up: Leveraging Google Apps Script for Advanced Automation</strong></p>

<p>While the built-in macro recording feature in Google Workspace offers a basic level of automation, Google Apps Script provides a far more powerful and versatile platform for extending the functionality of Docs, Sheets, and Forms through custom scripts written in JavaScript.27</p>

<p>In Google Sheets, Apps Script allows for automation beyond simple recorded macros. The Advanced Sheets service enables scripts to read and write data to specific ranges within a spreadsheet.30 For example, the following script demonstrates how to read data values from the range A1:D5 in Sheet1:</p>

<p>JavaScript</p>

<p>function readRange() {<br />
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();<br />
  const range = ss.getSheetByName(‘Sheet1’).getRange(‘A1:D5’);<br />
  const values = range.getValues();<br />
  Logger.log(values);<br />
}</p>

<p>Similarly, scripts can automate the creation of new sheets and pivot tables.30 Custom functions can be written to perform specific calculations or data manipulations directly within spreadsheet formulas.28 For instance, a function to calculate Value Added Tax (VAT) could be created and used like any built-in Sheets function. Furthermore, Apps Script facilitates the automation of email sending based on spreadsheet data. The MailApp service can be used to send personalized emails triggered by specific events or data changes within a sheet.28 Recurring tasks, such as generating weekly reports or performing data backups, can be automated using time-driven triggers that schedule scripts to run at specific intervals.31 For a more tailored user experience, Apps Script allows developers to create custom menus and sidebars within Google Sheets, providing interactive elements that can trigger specific script actions.31</p>

<p>Automation capabilities extend to Google Docs as well. The DocumentApp service enables scripts to programmatically create and modify documents, making it possible to automate tasks like mail merges or the generation of reports based on external data.31 Custom menus can also be added to Docs to streamline specific document-related workflows. While direct manipulation of PDF content within Docs using Apps Script is limited, scripts can interact with the text content of PDFs stored in Google Drive.40</p>

<p>Google Forms can also be enhanced through Apps Script. Custom submission confirmations and notifications can be created to provide more tailored feedback to respondents.41 Forms can be seamlessly integrated with Sheets and other Google services, automating data transfer and triggering actions based on form submissions.28 Event-driven triggers can be set up to run scripts automatically when a form is submitted, enabling immediate follow-up actions or data processing.35 While not strictly Apps Script, the creation of pre-filled form links offers another related automation technique for streamlining data collection by prepopulating certain fields for respondents.45</p>

<p>The true power of Google Apps Script lies in its ability to connect and automate workflows across the entire Google Workspace suite and even integrate with external services through its advanced services.30 Understanding the different types of triggers available, including simple triggers for basic events and installable triggers for more complex scenarios and broader access permissions, is crucial for effective automation.35 With only a foundational understanding of JavaScript, users can leverage Apps Script to create powerful custom solutions that significantly enhance their productivity within the Google Workspace environment.27</p>

<p><strong>V. Keep It Clever: Unconventional Uses of Google Keep for Productivity and Integration</strong></p>

<p>While Google Keep is often recognized for its basic note-taking capabilities, it offers a range of less obvious features and integration points that can significantly enhance productivity within the Google Workspace ecosystem.48</p>

<p>Beyond simple lists, Google Keep allows for advanced organization through the use of labels, which can be used to categorize notes by project, topic, or priority, enabling multi-dimensional filtering.58 Color-coding provides visual cues, allowing users to quickly identify different types of notes or prioritize tasks.58 Location-based reminders can be set to trigger notifications when a user arrives at or leaves a specific location, adding a contextual element to task management.58 For recurring tasks or routines, creating template notes with predefined sections can save time and ensure consistency.58 Google Keep can also serve as a temporary clipboard for quickly jotting down snippets of text or links before they are organized elsewhere.48</p>

<p>The integration of Google Keep with other Workspace applications extends beyond the immediately apparent. Users can easily drag and drop Keep notes directly into Google Docs and Slides, streamlining the process of incorporating notes into documents and presentations.50 Conversely, highlighted text or images from Docs and Slides can be saved directly to Keep using the “Save to Keep” option in the right-click menu.50 Keep notes can also be linked to specific Google Calendar events, appearing in the event details for quick reference during meetings or appointments.50 When saving emails as Keep notes, Keep automatically includes a direct link back to the original email, creating a seamless connection between notes and their email context.50 In collaborative environments, Keep notes can be used as a shared brainstorming tool within a shared Doc or Calendar event, allowing multiple users to contribute ideas in real-time.48</p>

<p>Several productivity hacks further enhance the utility of Google Keep. While labels are the primary organizational method, using hashtags within notes can provide quick, inline tagging.72 The “Grab image text” feature allows users to extract text from images within Keep notes, quickly digitizing information from visual sources.72 Important notes can be pinned to the top of the Keep interface for easy access.2 Default reminder times can be customized within Keep’s settings for quicker reminder setup.75 Finally, the Google Keep Chrome extension enables users to quickly save web pages and images directly to Keep notes while browsing.72</p>

<p>Google Keep’s strength lies in its simplicity and its fluid integration across the Google Workspace ecosystem. This allows users to seamlessly capture and access information within their workflow, making it a valuable tool for maintaining productivity without the need to switch between numerous specialized applications.48 While Keep offers its own reminder system, it’s important to note its integration with Google Tasks and Google Calendar, which provides a unified platform for managing to-dos and deadlines across different Google services.50</p>

<p><strong>VI. Mastering Your Files: Advanced Google Drive Search Operators and Filters</strong></p>

<p>Efficient file management is crucial for productivity, and Google Drive offers a range of advanced search operators and filters that go beyond basic keyword searches to help users quickly locate the files they need.83</p>

<p>For more precise searches, users can enclose exact phrases in quotation marks to find files containing those specific words in that order.83 Irrelevant results can be filtered out by using the minus sign before a word to exclude files containing that term.83 To find files owned by a specific person, the owner: operator followed by their email address can be used.83 It’s important to note that the from: operator now returns files shared with you by that address, while owner: specifically targets files owned by that address.87 Similarly, files shared with specific individuals can be found using the to: or sharedwith: operators followed by their email address.83</p>

<p>Google Drive also allows filtering by file type using the type: operator followed by the file extension or category, such as type:document, type:spreadsheet, or type:pdf.83 Files modified or created within a specific timeframe can be located using the before: and after: operators followed by the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.83 Important files that have been starred can be quickly accessed with the is:starred operator, and recently deleted files can be found using is:trashed.83 Files associated with specific Google Workspace applications can be filtered using the app: operator followed by the application name, for example, app:”Google Apps Script”.83 To focus the search on file titles, the title: operator can be used followed by relevant keywords.83 Large files can be identified using the size:, larger:, or smaller: operators followed by the file size in bytes or with units like MB or m.83 It’s worth noting that the behavior of the size: operator might vary, and using the Storage view to sort by file size might be a more reliable method for finding large files.98 Files that have lost their parent folder can be found using the query is:unorganized owner:me.83 While there isn’t a dedicated operator for searching within a specific folder, navigating to the folder and then using the search bar automatically filters results within that location.83 Alternatively, the parent: operator can be used with the folder ID.94</p>

<p>In addition to these operators, Google Drive offers visual filter chips below the search bar, allowing users to quickly narrow their search by file type, people, and modified date.83 These filter chips provide a user-friendly way to refine searches without the need to remember specific operators. By combining multiple search operators and utilizing filter chips, users can create highly specific queries that efficiently retrieve the desired files, saving significant time compared to manual browsing.83 While Google Drive’s search functionality is powerful, it’s important to note that it might not support all the advanced search techniques found in Google Search.99 For users with programming skills, the Google Drive API offers even more advanced search capabilities and operators for programmatic access to file searching.88</p>

<p><strong>VII. Inbox Innovation: Discovering Lesser-Known Gmail Productivity Features</strong></p>

<p>Gmail, beyond its fundamental email functionalities, offers a range of lesser-known features that can significantly enhance inbox productivity.95</p>

<p>Advanced search filters in Gmail allow for highly specific queries by combining various operators. For instance, users can search for emails from specific senders within a particular date range that also contain certain keywords in the subject and have attachments.95 Filtering by attachment type (e.g., documents, spreadsheets, PDFs) or by searching within specific labels or folders (like starred or important emails) further refines search results.95 The in:anywhere operator allows searching across all of Gmail, including the Spam and Trash folders.95 Filters can be quickly created directly from an email using the “Filter messages like this” option in the three-dot menu 108, and filter settings can be exported and imported between Gmail accounts for easy sharing and reuse.106</p>

<p>Canned responses, now known as Templates, go beyond basic replies by allowing users to create and save pre-written responses for frequently asked questions, product information, or standard greetings.110 These templates can be used for various scenarios like customer support, client onboarding, or recruitment, ensuring consistent and timely communication.110 Automatic replies can be set up by combining filters with canned responses.110 While Gmail doesn’t natively support variables in canned responses, they can be personalized manually before sending.111 For more advanced template management and features, third-party tools and browser extensions are available.49</p>

<p>Smart Compose, Gmail’s AI-powered writing assistant, offers several tips for optimal use. Suggestions can be quickly accepted by pressing the Tab key.130 Users can customize the feature by turning Smart Compose and Smart Compose personalization on or off in Gmail settings.130 Providing feedback on Smart Compose suggestions helps improve its accuracy.130 It’s important to remember that Smart Compose is an account-level setting and cannot be disabled for specific recipients.130</p>

<p>Schedule Send allows users to write emails and schedule them to be sent at a later date and time, optimizing delivery for recipients in different time zones or for sending reminders at specific times.125 This feature can be used for various purposes, such as sending time-sensitive offers or respecting work-life balance by composing emails outside of working hours but scheduling them to send during business hours.127 Scheduled emails can be accessed and managed in the “Scheduled” folder.139 It’s crucial to verify recipient addresses before scheduling and consider using a longer “Undo Send” period in conjunction with Schedule Send to allow for last-minute corrections.139</p>

<p><strong>VIII. Calendar as Command Center: Unconventional Task Management and Integration Strategies</strong></p>

<p>Google Calendar’s capabilities extend beyond basic scheduling, offering a versatile platform for managing tasks and integrating with various productivity tools.78</p>

<p>Tasks can be created and managed directly within the Google Calendar interface, allowing users to centralize their schedule and to-do lists in one view.78 Setting due dates and times for tasks ensures they appear on the calendar, providing a visual representation of deadlines and allowing for time allocation.78 Recurring tasks can be created for regular activities, automating the scheduling of routine items.146 Completed tasks can be marked as done to track progress 78, and these completed tasks can be hidden from the calendar view to reduce clutter.80 Users can also organize tasks into separate lists for different projects or areas of life, providing a more structured approach to task management.78</p>

<p>Beyond traditional task management, Google Calendar can be used unconventionally as a content calendar, allowing users to schedule content creation and publishing deadlines with color-coding to differentiate between platforms.81 It can also be integrated with habit tracking apps, syncing scheduled habits from the calendar for progress monitoring.156 The “Find a time” feature in Gmail leverages Google Calendar data to embed meeting slots directly into emails, streamlining the scheduling process.161 Integration with project management tools like ClickUp, Asana, and Trello allows for the synchronization of tasks and deadlines between the calendar and these platforms.151 Google Calendar also integrates seamlessly with video conferencing tools such as Zoom and Google Meet, automatically generating meeting links when events are created.167 Furthermore, users can employ Google Calendar for time blocking, scheduling specific time slots for focused work on tasks and projects, enhancing concentration and productivity.147</p>

<p>Several productivity hacks further enhance Google Calendar’s utility. Creating secondary calendars for different purposes (e.g., personal, work, projects) and color-coding them helps with visual organization.146 Default event reminder times can be set to ensure timely notifications 146, and adding a secondary time zone is beneficial for managing schedules across different locations.151 Advanced calendar searches can be performed using keywords, locations, or date ranges to quickly find specific events.151 Dragging and dropping events allows for easy rescheduling 151, and the calendar view can be customized to suit individual preferences (day, week, month, agenda, custom).146 Sharing calendars with colleagues or family members facilitates better coordination 146, and users can receive a daily agenda email to stay informed about upcoming events.149 Attachments can be added to calendar events to provide relevant documents or information 146, and appointment schedules can be created for easy booking of meetings with external stakeholders.78</p>

RPI4 &amp; Ubuntu MATE - How to enable video acceleration</p>

<p>Updated: June 27, 2020</p>

<p>Let’s fix another problem. This is a big one, and technically speaking, the most important one. Because if you intend to use <a href="https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/raspberry-pi-4-viable-desktop.html">Raspberry Pi 4 as a desktop system</a>, like I do, then hardware acceleration is a critical component of the overall experience. What this translates to, in layman’s terms: smooth video playback with low system resource utilization and less heating.</p>

<p>By default, even the earlier Pi models could play 1080p movies without a problem. This means you ought to get solid results here, too. However, the default configuration is not (currently) optimized for a desktop experience, and we will need to make a few manual changes. Let me show you what you need to do on the system level first - and then how to allow Firefox, Chromium and VLC to use hardware acceleration. After me.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hd-video.jpg" alt="Image 1: Teaser" /></p>

<h2 id="update-system--install-libraries">Update system &amp; install libraries</h2>

<p>The first, basic step is to update the system:</p>

<p>sudo apt-get update<br />
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</p>

<p>Then, you need to install a few wee libraries:</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa libgles2-mesa-dev xorg-dev</p>

<h2 id="configuration-file-tweaks">Configuration file tweaks</h2>

<p>We talked about this in my guide on <a href="https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-fix-screen-resolution.html">how to fix the screen resolution in MATE</a>, where you end up having either black bars top and bottom, or a black border around your desktop, and a weird resolution like 1824x984 instead of full HD 1920x1080. I will briefly repeat some of the stuff, for clarity.</p>

<p>There are two ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the guided tool called raspi-config. However, it may not be present in MATE or work correctly.</li>
  <li>Manually change the boot configuration file that is used to setup the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would recommend you go for the manual change, because it also allows you to better understand what you’re doing. The boot configuration is stored in the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>32-bit Raspberry Pis (up to Model 3) under /boot/config.txt.</li>
  <li>64-bit Raspberry Pi (Model 4) under /boot/firmware/usercfg.txt.</li>
</ul>

<p>On Raspberry Pi, /boot/firmware/config.txt also exists, but this file tells you not to write changes to it directly, and to use usercfg.txt. At the bottom of the config.txt file, there’s an include statement, which will pull all your manual overrides from the usercfg.txt file. So this is where we want to make the change.</p>

<p>Open the file in a text editor as root or sudo:</p>

<p>sudo nano /boot/firmware/usercfg.txt</p>

<p>Then add the following lines in there:</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d<br />
max_framebuffers=2<br />
gpu_mem=128<br />
hdmi_enable_4kp60=1</p>

<p>What we’re doing here, we’re enabling the 3D video driver (so-called Fake KMS), and we set the memory to 128 MB - please note that Pi 4 does GPU memory management differently from previous models, and since there is a discrete processor for graphics, you don’t need as much as you would use on earlier hardware.</p>

<p>Now, there are two other drivers you can try, provided you don’t get the hardware acceleration working as you like. So instead of dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d, you can use:</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d</p>

<p>Or this one:</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d-pi4</p>

<p>You can also change the memory allocation for the GPU, but <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/memory.md">this is not a trivial topic</a>. So we won’t go into that at this point. Just be aware that you have some flexibility in how much memory you want to allocate. The amount of RAM your Pi has will also play a role in getting the number right. 128 MB ought to be fine.</p>

<h3 id="memory-splitting-and-cma-allocation">Memory splitting and CMA allocation</h3>

<p>One more trick you can do is memory splitting. Basically, you can tell how much memory is allocated to the GPU and how much goes to the CPU. Normally, the memory is allocated dynamically, but you can do your own split. What it actually means is that once this value is crossed (in MB), the GPU will either request more memory from the CPU, or relinquish some back - this can lead to potential performance bottlenecks during intense operations, hence the split allows you to pre-optimize for characteristic use cases. You can see this configuration if you run the raspi-config tool, for instance. It allows you to specify how much memory will be given to the CPU (ARM), and how much to the GPU (VideoCore).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-memory-split.png" alt="Image 2: Memory split" /></p>

<p>The actual setting is then (either kms or fkms) something like:</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d, cma-128</p>

<p>dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d, cma-128</p>

<h2 id="reboot--check">Reboot &amp; check</h2>

<p>Once your Pi boots again, you can check that 3D drivers are loaded and working:</p>

<p>cat /proc/device-tree/soc/firmwarekms@7e600000/status</p>

<p>cat /proc/device-tree/v3dbus/v3d@7ec04000/status</p>

<p>If these two commands return okay, you have hardware acceleration on. If the result is disabled, try with a different dtoverlay option, reboot, and check again. Please be aware that you may not be able to turn the hardware acceleration on for some reason - kernel version, missing graphics stack utilities, etc. If that happens, just wait until the next system update.</p>

<h2 id="enable-hardware-acceleration-in-firefox">Enable hardware acceleration in Firefox</h2>

<p>Having your system with hardware acceleration is not enough. You also need to tell individual programs to use it. For whatever reason, neither Firefox nor Chromium have the right flags set by default. In Firefox, you can check the status with about:support. Go to Graphics and check the line that reads Compositing. If the value is Basic, you do not have hardware acceleration enabled.</p>

<p>To override, go to about:config, and search for the following key:</p>

<p>layers.acceleration.force-enabled</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-firefox-turn-layers-on.png" alt="Image 3: Firefox, turn layers on" /></p>

<p>And toggle it to true. Restart Firefox. Open the about:support page. The Compositing field should have the value OpenGL. Now you can watch videos as intended.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-firefox-compositing.png" alt="Image 4: Firefox, Compositing" /></p>

<h2 id="enable-hardware-acceleration-in-chromium">Enable hardware acceleration in Chromium</h2>

<p>Similarly, if you choose to use Chromium, it will initially report no HW acceleration under chrome://gpu. We can change that through chrome://flags. What you want is Override software rendering list, and change the setting to Enabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-chromium-experimental.png" alt="Image 5: Chromium, experimental features" /></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-chromium-gpu-flags.png" alt="Image 6: Chromium, GPU flags" /></p>

<p>Please note that some options will still read Disabled or Software only. This is because some of these are hardware-dependent (if you have say Windows and Nvidia graphics, do the same check, for fun), and some of these depend on OpenGL 3.0. To the best of my knowledge, Raspberry Pi only supports OpenGL 2.1.</p>

<h2 id="enable-hardware-acceleration-in-vlc">Enable hardware acceleration in VLC</h2>

<p>This is the simplest of the three. Tools &gt; Preferences. Click on Video. Under Video Settings &gt; Output, select OpenGL video output. Please note that if you’re trying this on a random distribution of choice, or if VLC has not been compiled with OpenGL, this won’t work, regardless of what your platform supports.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hw-accel-vlc-opengl-output.png" alt="Image 7: VLC, OpenGL" /></p>

<h2 id="testing--results">Testing &amp; results</h2>

<p>And now, you need to actually fire up some nice video content and see what gives.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dedoimedo.com/images/computers-years/2020-1/rpi4-ubuntu-mate-hd-video.jpg" alt="Image 8: HD video playback" /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I believe that over time, these issues will disappear, and you won’t be needing this guide. Well, I hope so. Looking at Ubuntu MATE - but also Raspberry Pi OS, the defaults are not designed with too much focus for desktop use just yet. That’s understandable, but for anyone who does seek to use the Pi as an ordinary mouse and keyboard system, this means a lot of extra work.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this tutorial has all the pieces you need to have an enjoyable multimedia experience. In the next article in this series, we will discuss, you guessed it, audio, a second and just as critical component. That would be all for now, stay tuned.</p>

## Leveraging `autorandr` for Seamless Projector and Monitor Connections on Raspberry Pi 4B (openSUSE Tumbleweed)

### Why Use `autorandr`?

`autorandr` automatically detects connected displays and applies pre-saved configurations, eliminating manual adjustments each time you connect to a new projector or monitor. This is ideal for professors frequently moving between classrooms with varying display setups.

### Benefits for Your Scenario:
- **Automatic Detection:** Automatically selects correct display configurations.
- **Ease of Use:** Eliminates repetitive manual configuration.
- **Flexibility:** Manages multiple display profiles easily.
- **Robustness:** Handles common EDID detection issues gracefully.

---

## Step-by-Step Installation and Configuration:

### Step 1: Install `autorandr`

**Recommended Method (openSUSE Build Service):**
```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:phillipberndt/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:phillipberndt.repo
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install autorandr
```

**Alternative Method (pip, limited integration):**
```bash
sudo pip install autorandr
```
*Note: pip installation may not integrate seamlessly with system services like systemd or udev.*

### Step 2: Create and Save Display Profiles

Connect to a projector or monitor, configure manually once, then save:
```bash
autorandr --save classroom_projector
```

Repeat for other setups:
```bash
autorandr --save ultrawide_monitor
```

### Step 3: Verify Saved Profiles
```bash
autorandr --list
```

### Step 4: Automatic Detection and Application

To apply configuration manually:
```bash
autorandr --change
```

To automate this completely, enable autorandr's systemd service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable autorandr.service
sudo systemctl start autorandr.service
```

### Step 5: Create a Default Fallback Profile

Create a generic fallback profile (e.g., 1920x1080):
```bash
autorandr --save default
```

Set as default:
```bash
autorandr --default default
```

---

## Advanced Usage:

### Wildcard EDID Matching (Practical Example)

Edit `~/.config/autorandr/classroom_projector/setup`:
```
HDMI-1 00ffffffffffff00*
```
This matches multiple similar projectors connected to HDMI-1.

---

## Alternative Hardware-Based Solution:

Consider using an **HDMI EDID Emulator** (dummy plug) for consistent EDID data and resolution compatibility without software configuration.

---

## Troubleshooting:

- **List Detected Profiles:**
```bash
autorandr --detected
```

- **Debugging Mode:**
```bash
autorandr --change --debug
```

---

## Official Documentation:

- [autorandr GitHub Repository](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr)
- [openSUSE Build Service autorandr Package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:phillipberndt/autorandr)

---

## Summary:

Using `autorandr`, you can seamlessly manage multiple projector and monitor configurations without manual intervention. Save common setups once, and `autorandr` automatically applies the correct configuration whenever you connect your Raspberry Pi 4B to a new projector or monitor. This simplifies your workflow, allowing you to focus on teaching rather than troubleshooting display issues.

Ensure the expansion is accurate, comprehensive, relevant, and strictly maintains the original tone and focus.
The AI assistant is advanced and capable of self-correction. The expansion requires elaborating on existing points, adding relevant examples, and introducing related sub-points where appropriate. The primary goal is to add substantive value (e.g., deeper explanations, details on 'how' and 'why'), not merely increase word count. The final output will be evaluated for target length, relevance, clarity, substance, lack of repetition, and logical flow.
1.  Retrieve and thoroughly review the complete text of the specific AI response targeted for expansion (i.e., the response immediately prior to the user's expansion request in the current conversation).
2.  Identify the core message, key arguments, main points, structure, and overall tone of that original response.
3.  Brainstorm potential areas for elaboration, specific examples that could be added, supporting details, and logical sub-topics relevant to the existing content.
4.  Evaluate the identified points from the original response to determine where expansion would add the most value (e.g., enhancing clarity, providing depth, adding supporting evidence).
5.  Critically assess the brainstormed examples, details, and sub-topics for direct relevance and logical coherence, ensuring they support or extend the original points without deviating from the core purpose.
6.  Consider the target length (approx. double) and plan how to distribute the additional content effectively across the original structure to maintain balance and narrative flow.
7.  Analyze the original tone and writing style to ensure the newly generated content integrates seamlessly and consistently.
Develop a structured, detailed plan for executing the expansion. This plan should outline:
* Which specific sections or points of the original response will be expanded.
* What specific details, explanations, examples, or data points will be added to each targeted section.
* Which new, related sub-points (if any) will be introduced and where they fit logically within the existing structure.
* A strategy to ensure the final text flows logically, transitions smoothly, and maintains a consistent tone throughout.
* A projection or check to ensure the planned additions are likely to achieve the target length increase substantively.
Draft the expanded response according to the formulated plan. During the drafting process:
* Systematically integrate the planned details, examples, and explanations into the text.
* Continuously self-correct and refine: check if additions genuinely add substance and value, not just verbosity. Ensure clarity and precision in wording.
* Pay close attention to transitions between original and new content, ensuring they are smooth and logical.
* Monitor the tone and relevance constantly, adjusting as needed to maintain consistency with the original response.
* Keep track of the evolving length to ensure it is progressing towards the target (roughly double).
Produce the final, expanded version of the response. This output should incorporate all planned additions and refinements made during the execution and self-correction phase, resulting in a cohesive, comprehensive, and significantly more detailed text compared to the original.
Before finalizing, review the generated expanded text against the initial requirements and goals:
* Is the length approximately double the original?
* Has the core message, original tone, and focus been strictly maintained?
* Is the added content relevant, accurate, substantial, and well-integrated?
* Does the text flow logically? Is it clear, coherent, and easy to understand?
* Are there any unintended redundancies, awkward phrasing, or areas that could be further polished?
Based on the preceding analysis and plan, generate the expanded version of your response that immediately preceded this request. The expanded text must be approximately double the original length. Achieve this by adding substantive details, examples, and elaborations to the existing points while strictly maintaining the original response's core purpose, relevance, and tone.

The AI assistant is advanced and capable of self-correction. The expansion requires elaborating on existing points, adding relevant examples, and introducing related sub-points where appropriate. The primary goal is to add substantive value (e.g., deeper explanations, details on 'how' and 'why'), not merely increase word count. The final output will be evaluated for target length, relevance, clarity, substance, lack of repetition, and logical flow.
1.  Retrieve and thoroughly review the complete text of the specific AI response targeted for expansion (i.e., the response immediately prior to the user's expansion request in the current conversation).
2.  Identify the core message, key arguments, main points, structure, and overall tone of that original response.
3.  Brainstorm potential areas for elaboration, specific examples that could be added, supporting details, and logical sub-topics relevant to the existing content.
4.  Evaluate the identified points from the original response to determine where expansion would add the most value (e.g., enhancing clarity, providing depth, adding supporting evidence).
5.  Critically assess the brainstormed examples, details, and sub-topics for direct relevance and logical coherence, ensuring they support or extend the original points without deviating from the core purpose.
6.  Consider the target length (approx. double) and plan how to distribute the additional content effectively across the original structure to maintain balance and narrative flow.
7.  Analyze the original tone and writing style to ensure the newly generated content integrates seamlessly and consistently.
Develop a structured, detailed plan for executing the expansion. This plan should outline:
* Which specific sections or points of the original response will be expanded.
* What specific details, explanations, examples, or data points will be added to each targeted section.
* Which new, related sub-points (if any) will be introduced and where they fit logically within the existing structure.
* A strategy to ensure the final text flows logically, transitions smoothly, and maintains a consistent tone throughout.
* A projection or check to ensure the planned additions are likely to achieve the target length increase substantively.
Draft the expanded response according to the formulated plan. During the drafting process:
* Systematically integrate the planned details, examples, and explanations into the text.
* Continuously self-correct and refine: check if additions genuinely add substance and value, not just verbosity. Ensure clarity and precision in wording.
* Pay close attention to transitions between original and new content, ensuring they are smooth and logical.
* Monitor the tone and relevance constantly, adjusting as needed to maintain consistency with the original response.
* Keep track of the evolving length to ensure it is progressing towards the target (roughly double).
Produce the final, expanded version of the response. This output should incorporate all planned additions and refinements made during the execution and self-correction phase, resulting in a cohesive, comprehensive, and significantly more detailed text compared to the original.
Before finalizing, review the generated expanded text against the initial requirements and goals:
* Is the length approximately double the original?
* Has the core message, original tone, and focus been strictly maintained?
* Is the added content relevant, accurate, substantial, and well-integrated?
* Does the text flow logically? Is it clear, coherent, and easy to understand?
* Are there any unintended redundancies, awkward phrasing, or areas that could be further polished?
Based on the preceding analysis and plan, generate the expanded version of your response that immediately preceded this request. The expanded text must be approximately double the original length. Achieve this by adding substantive details, examples, and elaborations to the existing points while strictly maintaining the original response's core purpose, relevance, and tone. Ensure the final output is comprehensive, clear, flows logically, and integrates the new information seamlessly.

Analyze the underlying business drivers (e.g., market agility, cost reduction, scalability, compliance, talent attraction). Explicitly consider the opportunity cost – what strategic features or initiatives are being deferred to undertake this refactoring? Challenge the objective if necessary: ‘What is the quantifiable evidence that this specific refactoring solution is the most effective way to address the identified problem?’ ‘Have alternative, less disruptive approaches (e.g., targeted optimizations, tactical wrappers) been adequately evaluated?’ ‘What are the specific, measurable business outcomes expected, and how will they be tracked?’Exhaustive Ecosystem Artifact Identification &amp; Dependency Mapping: Systematically and exhaustively identify all potentially affected artifacts across the entire socio-technical system. Employ a multi-pronged, evidence-based approach:Automated Analysis: Leverage advanced dependency analysis tools, visualizing complex dependency graphs (code, infrastructure, data). Utilize SAST/DAST tools, linters, and code quality platforms (SonarQube) to baseline current state and identify areas impacted by proposed changes. Analyze CI/CD logs and deployment manifests for implicit dependencies.Targeted Search &amp; Pattern Recognition: Perform sophisticated searches across codebases, configuration repositories, documentation wikis, and issue trackers for specific API usage, deprecated patterns, anti-patterns, configuration keys, hardcoded values, relevant architectural decisions (ADRs), and operational incidents related to the target area.Manual Tracing, Exploration &amp; Interviews: Manually trace critical business transactions and data flows end-to-end. Review key code sections, database schemas (including stored procedures, triggers, functions, data lineage), message queue/event stream definitions and schemas, external/internal API contracts (and their consumers/providers), infrastructure-as-code definitions (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.), operational runbooks, disaster recovery plans, capacity plans, compliance documentation (e.g., GDPR impact assessment, SOX controls), and security policies. Conduct targeted interviews with domain experts, operations staff, security teams, and architects.Consider All Artifact Types: Add more detail on how to handle dependencies between different artifact types. For example: ‘If a database schema is changed, how does this impact ORM mappings, data access layers, and UI components that display the data?’ Look beyond primary code to include: configuration files (all formats), environment variables, feature flag definitions/usage, build scripts (all types), CI/CD pipeline definitions/scripts, containerization files (Dockerfile, compose), deployment manifests (K8s, Helm, Terraform, CloudFormation), unit/integration/E2E/performance/contract/security test suites, database schemas/migrations/seed data/stored procedures, API documentation (internal/external), system design documents, architectural diagrams/ADRs, runbooks/playbooks, monitoring/alerting configs, logging configurations, security policies/controls, compliance evidence, cost models/reports, user documentation, training materials, and even team structure/skill matrices.Detail the precise nature and severity of the impact for each identified component. Critically distinguish and elaborate on:Direct Modifications: Code/artifacts requiring explicit changes. Specify the type of change (e.g., API signature change, logic rewrite, dependency upgrade, schema alteration).Indirect Consequences: Add more specific examples of indirect consequences, such as: ‘If a library is upgraded, how does this affect all modules that use that library, including potential version conflicts or API changes?’ Components relying on modified code. Analyze API contracts meticulously (including implicit contracts). Consider impacts on derived classes, dependent services, data consumers/producers, and UI components. Assess the difficulty of adapting these dependencies.Potential Ripple Effects (NFRs &amp; Systemic Qualities): Analyze impacts quantitatively or qualitatively across:Performance: Baseline key metrics (latency percentiles, throughput, resource utilization). Estimate potential changes and define performance testing requirements.Security: Analyze changes to attack surface, potential introduction/mitigation of specific CWEs, impact on authentication/authorization/encryption, data privacy/residency implications. Define security validation requirements (threat modeling, pen testing).Reliability: Analyze impact on failure modes, error handling, fault tolerance mechanisms, MTBF/MTTR. Define reliability testing needs (e.g., chaos engineering experiments).Maintainability: Code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity), readability, testability, ease of debugging, adherence to coding standards.Operability: Impact on deployment frequency/safety, monitoring effectiveness, logging usefulness, ease of troubleshooting, configuration management complexity.Usability: Add examples of specific usability considerations, such as: ‘Will the refactoring introduce any changes to user workflows? Will it require updates to user documentation or training materials?’ Potential changes to user workflows or interfaces, even if unintentional.Specify the required output format for this analysis to enable clear prioritization and risk assessment. For example: ‘Generate a detailed, sortable, and filterable table listing each affected component (precise identifier), its type, the specific nature of impact, a detailed description of change/interaction, estimated complexity (e.g., Fibonacci scale), likelihood of impact occurring (Low/Med/High), potential severity if impact occurs (Low/Med/High), detectability (Easy/Med/Hard), proposed priority (P1-P4), confidence level of this assessment (Low/Med/High), and initial thoughts on mitigation difficulty.’Generate a Comprehensive, Strategic, Economic, and Actionable Refactoring Plan Document:Strategic Program Blueprint: Construct a detailed, well-organized document titled “Refactoring Plan”. Emphasize its role as the definitive blueprint, central communication artifact, economic justification, risk management framework, and living guide for a potentially long-running, multi-team initiative.Strategic Goals (SMART, Aligned, Measured): Clearly articulate the primary Goals, ensuring they are SMART, directly linked to business OKRs/KPIs and technical strategy (e.g., specific architectural principles, quality attribute targets based on ISO 25010). Define both leading indicators (predicting success during the program) and lagging indicators (measuring success after completion). Add more specific examples of leading and lagging indicators. For example: ‘Leading indicators: % of code refactored, test coverage of refactored code, number of critical vulnerabilities identified and fixed. Lagging indicators: reduction in bug reports, improvement in deployment frequency, reduction in mean time to recovery (MTTR), increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS) due to improved system reliability.’Compelling Rationale &amp; Economic Justification: Provide a robust, data-driven Rationale. Include a formal Cost-Benefit Analysis section: estimate total costs (developer effort, infrastructure changes, tooling, training, potential disruption/downtime, opportunity cost) versus quantifiable benefits (reduced maintenance costs, increased development velocity, improved performance/reliability leading to revenue/retention gains, new market capabilities enabled, specific risk reduction). Calculate estimated ROI or payback period where feasible. Justify the effort against concrete alternatives with their own cost/benefit profiles. Use metrics (code churn, bug density, complexity scores, lead time for changes) to quantify the “cost of inaction.”Granular, Phased Technical Approach (Patterns, Strategies, Observability): Describe the proposed technical Approach in extensive, granular detail, likely broken into distinct phases or workstreams. Outline sequences, specific patterns, algorithms, architectural changes, data handling/migration strategies, and crucially, the observability strategy during the refactoring. Explicitly detail:Preparatory Steps: E.g., enhancing test coverage to a specific target percentage, establishing detailed baseline performance/reliability metrics, setting up required infrastructure/tooling/environments, performing necessary dependency upgrades first, creating Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for key choices.Core Refactoring Steps: Break down major transformations into smaller, verifiable sub-steps. Detail strategies for complex scenarios like database schema evolution (zero-downtime techniques like expand/contract, parallel run with feature flags, trigger-based synchronization), monolith decomposition (Strangler Fig implementation, anti-corruption layers, event-driven decoupling patterns, API gateway integration), managing parallel refactoring efforts across teams (defining clear interfaces, integration points, coordination mechanisms).API Versioning Strategy: Define how APIs will be versioned and managed during the transition to minimize disruption for consumers.Feature Flag Strategy: Detail implementation, rollout strategy (canary, blue-green, percentage-based), A/B testing capabilities if applicable, robust monitoring of flag impact, and rigorous flag cleanup process/timeline.Observability Plan: Define specific metrics, logs, and traces needed to monitor the health, performance, and correctness of both old and new code paths during the transition. Specify required dashboards and alerting.Integration &amp; Verification: Define branching strategy (potentially long-lived release branches for large efforts), CI/CD pipeline adaptations (e.g., parallel pipelines, environment promotion strategy), incremental integration points, and rigorous verification at each stage (automated tests, code reviews, architectural reviews, manual checks).Post-Refactoring Cleanup &amp; Handover: Detail steps for decommissioning old code/flags/infrastructure, updating all relevant documentation comprehensively, final end-to-end validation, knowledge transfer to operations/support teams, and potentially a post-mortem analysis.Data Migration Strategy: Add more detail on how to handle potential data migration challenges. For example: ‘If the refactoring involves changes to the database schema, provide a detailed migration plan, including data validation, rollback procedures, and potential downtime considerations. Consider different migration strategies, such as blue-green deployments or online schema changes.’ Provide a detailed plan for data migration if needed, including validation, rollback, and potential downtime considerations.Elaborate significantly and proactively on potential Risks, brainstorming exhaustively and realistically across categories (Technical, Process, Organizational, Financial, Security, Compliance, External Dependencies). Include complex risks like cascading failures during transition, data corruption undetected for periods, long-running branch divergence hell, team burnout/attrition, knowledge silos hindering progress, configuration drift across complex environments, regulatory/compliance violations introduced, or critical third-party dependencies failing.For each significant identified risk, propose concrete, practical, verifiable, and potentially layered Mitigation Strategies. Include advanced techniques where appropriate: rigorous code reviews (consider checklists), pair/mob programming, comprehensive automated testing pyramid (unit, integration, component, contract, E2E, performance, security scanning, mutation testing) with specific coverage/quality goals, feature flags/toggles, canary releases/blue-green deployments with fine-grained monitoring and automated rollback triggers, dedicated integration/staging environments mirroring production, chaos engineering principles to test resilience, frequent small commits/pushes integrated via robust CI/CD with automated quality gates, automated rollback capabilities (code/config/data), comprehensive data backup/validation/restore drills, formal ADRs for critical decisions, regular stakeholder demos and transparent progress reporting, very clear Definition of Done, external security audits/pen-testing, dedicated refactoring teams or protected time, formal knowledge sharing mechanisms, and potentially architectural fitness functions. Expand on the concept of architectural fitness functions. For example: ‘Define specific architectural fitness functions (automated tests that measure architectural qualities like performance, security, and maintainability) to ensure the refactoring doesn’t degrade the overall architecture. These functions should be continuously monitored throughout the refactoring process.’Include Comprehensive, Detailed Dedicated Sections:Multi-Level Testing Strategy: Define scope, goals, tools, environments, responsibilities, test data management (generation/masking/subsetting), and acceptance criteria for each relevant testing level (unit, integration, component, contract, API, E2E, UAT, performance, load, stress, security, usability, accessibility, disaster recovery, rollback). Include strategy for maintaining test suites during heavy code churn. Add exploratory testing charters.Robust, Validated Rollback Plan: Define precise quantitative triggers for rollback, detailed step-by-step procedures (automated where possible) for reverting code/config/data across all affected systems, validation procedures post-rollback, communication plan during rollback execution, and plan for post-rollback root cause analysis.Integrated Security Validation Plan: Outline when (design, implementation, testing, deployment), how (SAST, DAST, IAST, SCA, manual code review, pen-testing, threat modeling updates, compliance checks), and by whom security will be assessed. Define specific security acceptance criteria and processes for handling identified vulnerabilities.Stakeholder Communication Plan &amp; Matrix: Add a section on ‘Communication and Collaboration Strategy’. This section should detail how the refactoring effort will be communicated to stakeholders, how collaboration will be facilitated between teams, and how conflicts will be resolved. This is crucial for large-scale refactoring projects.Example:’Communication and Collaboration Strategy: Define a clear communication and collaboration strategy to ensure all stakeholders are informed and aligned.Stakeholder Identification and Analysis: Identify all stakeholders (internal and external) and their needs.Communication Channels and Frequency: Define communication channels (e.g., regular meetings, email updates, shared documentation) and frequency for each stakeholder group.Collaboration Mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for collaboration between teams (e.g., shared repositories, communication tools, joint workshops).Conflict Resolution Process: Define a process for resolving conflicts that may arise during the refactoring effort.’Resource Allocation, Skills &amp; Budget: Identify teams/individuals, required skills (include skill gap analysis and training plan if needed), dependencies on shared resources/platforms, detailed effort estimation (e.g., using multiple techniques), realistic timeline with phases/milestones/buffers, and allocated budget.Rigorous Definition of Done (DoD): Define specific, verifiable, agreed-upon criteria for program completion. Provide concrete acceptance conditions and how they will be verified and signed off by specific roles (e.g., Architect, Security Officer, Product Owner, SRE Lead, Business Sponsor).Define the Scope Explicitly, Rigorously, Defensively, Collaboratively, and Visually:Contractual &amp; Visual Scope Section: Integrate a distinct, unambiguous “Scope” section. Explicitly state its purpose as a contract. Use visualization techniques (e.g., architectural diagrams, context maps based on Domain-Driven Design principles) to clearly delineate boundaries.Precise In-Scope Definition: List precisely all artifacts in scope, using unambiguous identifiers. Clearly state the intended change type.Aggressive &amp; Justified Out-of-Scope Definition: Explicitly, extensively, and proactively list anything out of scope, providing the rationale for each exclusion to prevent ambiguity and manage expectations.Formal Scope Change Control Process: Detail the formal process for handling scope change requests, including impact assessment (effort, timeline, risk, cost, dependencies), approval workflow, and integration with program governance and delivery cadences (e.g., sprint planning, PI planning).Identify, Characterize, Justify, Track, and Analyze the Preliminary Change Set:Initial Footprint Prediction &amp; Justification: Compile the preliminary Change Set list based on analysis/scope. Justify the prediction.Categorization, Utility &amp; Tracking: Categorize files clearly. Explain utility for tracking, reviews, CI/CD, parallel work planning. Discuss linking files to work items/tickets. Analyze the set for potential hotspots (frequently changed files needing extra coordination) or impacts on build/deployment infrastructure. Consider using this to inform static analysis rule configurations during the refactoring.Purpose, Limitations &amp; Evolution: Emphasize this is a preliminary estimate expected to evolve. Stress the importance of tracking the actual change set against this baseline to identify scope drift or unexpected impacts early.Embed Iterative Refinement, Continuous Feedback, and Adaptive Governance:Living Document &amp; Governance: Conclude the plan by stating it’s a living document governed by the defined change control process.Review Checkpoints &amp; Cadence: Recommend specific checkpoints, review gates, or cadences (e.g., end-of-phase reviews, quarterly program reviews) where the plan’s validity, assumptions, risks, scope, timeline, and budget are formally reassessed and adapted based on learnings and evolving context.Feedback Loop &amp; Metrics: Emphasize incorporating feedback from retrospectives (specifically focused on the refactoring process), code reviews, testing, monitoring data, and stakeholder input. Define leading metrics to track if the plan is on course before major milestones are missed.Generate a program plan that embodies exceptional thoroughness, strategic alignment, economic awareness, proactive risk management, actionable detail, and adaptive governance, thereby maximizing the probability of a successful, predictable, and high-value enterprise-scale refactoring initiative.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="scratchpad" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Matthias Steiner lift</title><link href="https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Matthias Steiner lift" /><published>2025-04-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-04-01T08:36:45+00:00</updated><id>https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ib.bsb.br/steiner-lift/"><![CDATA[<video controls="">

You then simply copy your OS installer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.iso</code> files, WinPE images (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.iso</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.wim</code>), and even full Windows installations packaged in virtual hard disk files (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhd</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhdx</code>) onto this data partition. When you boot from the Ventoy drive, it scans the data partition and presents a menu listing all compatible files, allowing you to boot directly from them.</li>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Extremely easy to set up and manage – just copy/delete files to add/remove OS options.</li>
      <li>No complex manual partitioning required for each OS.</li>
      <li>Excellent compatibility with UEFI (including Secure Boot) and Legacy BIOS modes.</li>
      <li>Supports a wide variety of image types (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.iso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.wim</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.img</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vhd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vhdx</code>).</li>
      <li>Supports persistence for many Linux live ISOs (saving changes across boots, requires creating a persistence file).</li>
      <li>Can directly boot full Windows installations from VHD(x) files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Slight boot overhead compared to a direct installation (usually negligible).</li>
      <li>Performance of OSs running from VHD(x) depends on the VHD type (fixed vs. dynamic), the underlying drive speed, and the USB connection.</li>
      <li>While compatibility is high, rare niche ISOs might have issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Setup Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Ventoy tool from the official website.</li>
      <li>Run the tool and install Ventoy onto your 1TB external HDD (this will erase the drive initially!). Choose the desired partition scheme (MBR for legacy, GPT for UEFI recommended).</li>
      <li>Once Ventoy is installed, the drive will appear with a large partition. Copy your desired files onto this partition:
        <ul>
          <li>Linux ISOs (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ubuntu-lts.iso</code>)</li>
          <li>Windows Installer ISOs (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows11.iso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows81.iso</code>)</li>
          <li>WinPE ISOs or WIMs.</li>
          <li><strong>For full Windows installs (Win 11/8.1 To Go style):</strong> Create a VHD(x) file first:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Method A (Recommended): Install directly to VHD:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Disk Management</code> (diskmgmt.msc) in Windows to create a new VHD(x) file (choose VHDX, Fixed size for better performance, allocate sufficient space like 64GB+).</li>
                  <li>Attach the created VHD(x) file in Disk Management (it will appear as a new uninitialized disk). Initialize it (GPT recommended) and create a simple volume (format NTFS).</li>
                  <li>Boot your computer using a standard Windows Installer USB/ISO (you can even boot the Windows ISO via Ventoy itself).</li>
                  <li>At the “Where do you want to install Windows?” screen, press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift+F10</code> to open Command Prompt. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diskpart</code> commands to list volumes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list volume</code>) identify the drive letter of your attached VHD, and select the correct partition.</li>
                  <li>Proceed with the installation, selecting the partition on the attached VHD as the target.</li>
                  <li>After installation completes <em>inside the VHD</em>, detach the VHD in Disk Management.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Method B (Capture Existing):</strong> Use a tool like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disk2vhd</code> (from Microsoft Sysinternals) to capture an existing Windows installation into a VHD(x) file.</li>
              <li>Copy the final <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.vhdx</code> file onto the Ventoy data partition.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Safely eject the drive. Boot your target computer from the USB drive. Ventoy’s menu should appear, allowing you to select and boot your desired OS image or VHD.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<p>To implement this solution:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Save the backup script as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/backup-opensuse.sh</code></li>
  <li>Make it executable: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/backup-opensuse.sh</code></li>
  <li>Save the service file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/system/backup-opensuse.service</code></li>
  <li>Save the timer file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/systemd/system/backup-opensuse.timer</code></li>
  <li>Enable and start the timer:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable backup-opensuse.timer
sudo systemctl start backup-opensuse.timer
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Verify the timer is active:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl list-timers backup-opensuse.timer
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Test the backup manually:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo systemctl start backup-opensuse.service
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Monitor the backup progress:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo journalctl -fu backup-opensuse.service
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
