![Image 1](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44096473&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I used GitHub issues as a form of project management to plan my wedding many years ago. My wife was skeptical at first, but the ability to add labels, search, etc made it really easy to work together and accomplish the tasked we needed in time for the wedding. The hardest part was creating a bookmark that links directly to the issue tracker. Oh, I’ve also used GitHub issues to organize all the boxes in my most recent move. I would create an issue and the description would list all the contents of a box. Then I would write the issue number on the box. After moving, I could search GitHub to find that one thing I was looking for and know what box it was in.

Using smallish boxes (30-40 paperbacks each) so that carrying them is not a backbreaker. Scan the ISBN barcodes with phone app, fix old ones/whatever on web app, tag with box number written on at least two sides. No problems found so far.

There could be a bunch odd reasons that many boxes remain unpacked; downsizing, temporary housing. It’d be nice to be able to finds the one thing you need (you could even label the issue with the box location!). Anyway, a fun solution but I think it’s more effort than I would have been willing to put in even if I would have appreciated the outcome.
![Image 4](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098053&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I moved a couple weeks ago, and was quite confused when--after repeatedly searching through every kitchen box--we were missing the flour, sugar, and pasta. Turns out one kitchen box got placed at the bottom of in a pile of book boxes in the living room. If you unpack in a day, it's no big deal, but if you spent a week unpacking, you may find yourself having to eat something other than spaghetti for lunch, which is normally fine, but not when you really want spaghetti and the lack of spaghetti merely makes you more determined to find it.
![Image 5](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098458&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I put a colored sticker on each box, where the color corresponds to the room where the box should go. The destination rooms are marked with the same stickers during the move, so helpers have an easy time telling where to put each box. In addition, I’m numbering the boxes, and when packing them keep a list mapping the numbers to what’s in each box. So when later searching for something, I know it should be in box number _x_. This can be helpful even years later when you don’t unpack all boxes.
![Image 6](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098683&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)> This can be helpful even years later when you don’t unpack all boxes. Indeed, this is one of the biggest reasons I tracked this information to begin with.

But lunch that first day ended up being something else.

![Image 8](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44099826&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)> If you unpack in a day, it's no big deal I think you’re supposed to unpack 80% on day one, and keep the rest boxed up for the next move?

![Image 9](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44101279&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Wouldn't a single text document have achieved the same purpose? With a heading for each box?

![Image 10](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098003&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Because searching for a thing across all issues is way faster than eyeballing the list written on each box?
![Image 11](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098712&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Correct. There’s no way you’re going to write every item inside the box on the box itself. And definitely not on every side of the box. Think cables and small items. It only makes sense if you plan on unpacking over a year but if you unpack everything in a couple days then the system is not as useful.

![Image 12](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097629&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)At my last job we almost used Gitlab for all our project management. The only thing that stopped us was not being able to use references between projects. It's very project focused, which is of course good enough for open source projects. But at my current job Gitlab could easily take over Youtrack, already took over Upsource.

![Image 13](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097558&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Reminds me of: [https://xkcd.com/1172/](https://xkcd.com/1172/) This is a fun anecdote to share, but everywhere you can find people with absurd workflows that are better dealt with using proper tools. FWIW I used Org mode to organize a move to another country. I really cannot stand the idea of feeding my personal information to Microsoft.

![Image 15](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098453&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)This is fun: it turns out you can paste this GraphQL query: ``` { viewer { issueComments { totalCount } issues { totalCount } } } ``` Into [https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer) in order to see the total number of issues and comments you've posted over your time on GitHub. I got 9,413 issues and 39,087 comments, for a grand total of 48,500 combined!
![Image 16](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44104761&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Years ago I was using GitHub Issues as my personal task manager But ~ 2 years ago I switched to Obsidian for that Eventually I event started used Obsidian for my project management, and ditched GitHub Issues / GitHub Projects With caveats, that I use that for the greenfield project with lots of unstructured exploration + AI agents for keeping design docs and figuring out detailed tasks For the established and legacy projects, I would probably use GitHub Issues for bugs, enhancement requests. And GitHub Projects for all reactive work (support, ops, bugs, etc.) Lastly, I disagree that it's _"almost the best notebook in the world"_. It my might be a best ticketing system or a note taking system, but not a notebook in the sense of Jupyter or LiveBook (but nothing stopping them to make code blocks executable[1], and even add some LLMs). Also it's easy overwrite the content of the issue, even by a single person working from different tabs (at least that was the case in the past). --- 1. GitHub Blocks [https://blocks.githubnext.com/](https://blocks.githubnext.com/)
![Image 17](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097110&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I expected the first comment to be about privacy. I don’t keep a lot of notes but I definitely consider them even more private than even email. Not sure I want them training LLMs. Or are there actually assurances from MS around privacy for private repos?
![Image 18](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097406&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)The amount of extremely sensitive corporate secrets in GitHub issues makes me assume that their security and privacy are pretty rock solid. A lot of companies pay GitHub a _lot_ of money to look after their source code and related artifacts. That's GitHub's business model. I don't think they would jeopardize that trust for the sake of training a model on private data.
![Image 19](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098086&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Where I work we don’t use GitHub, but we do use Copilot. It took a long time before it was opened up for us to be able to use it, as deals had to be struck and accounts and auth setup to use our corporate logins, which have different rules for data privacy than public use of Copilot. We are explicitly forbidden from using the public version of Copilot, or any other AI for that matter. I can only assume that companies paying for GitHub also pay for enhanced levels of privacy. Just because a company can pay GitHub not to train on their data, doesn’t mean they’re not going to train on your data that is being hosted for free. They are almost certainly crawling all free repos.
![Image 20](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098615&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I dunno. For one thing, those companies are paying GitHub a lot of money for the enterprise version, separately hosted (right?). The data isn't actually available to Microsoft employees or LLMs, absent some security flaw or backdoor. For another, companies that pay for this also (sample size is small, though) have automation that scans GitHub repos, issues, etc for any secrets and require them to be removed and scrubbed from history, implying that they don't trust even the self-hosted GitHub Enterprise as much as you do.
![Image 21](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098817&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I see secrets as a different issue. Putting those in an issue or repo exposes them to potentially hundreds of people within your own company, that's bad practice.
![Image 22](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44099589&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I remember awhile back that they were and do train on repositories to the point that I never wanted to use GitHub for anything other than submitting bug reports to projects. Maybe the non-training only applies if you pay protection money? But then you run into the whole if it's public there's nothing stopping some other AI that isn't MS from accessing the repository and training on it.
![Image 23](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44101078&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)There's been a huge amount of speculative information floating around that GitHub are training on private repos, but I've never seen anything credible.
![Image 24](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098690&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Assumptions are not sufficient when it comes to basic human rights. And my assumption is that they do or will use your data from their own interest as the likelihood that someone within Microsoft will benefit tends to 1 as time tends to infinity. privacy needs to be verifiable (Apple has show this is possible with private cloud compute)

![Image 26](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44099905&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)It's such a wasted opportunity too. It would be so powerful to understand how a tool is used by searching for popular repositories that are already using it.

![Image 27](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44101804&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Maybe I have my search syntax wrong. Suppose I want to search for go projects with a flake.nix in the repo root. This finds nothing: ``` language:Go path:/flake.nix ``` I know they exist though, for instance here's one: github.com/joerdav/xc Can you tell me where I've gone wrong?

![Image 29](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44096220&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Like many I've been looking for the best note-taking app for years. And somehow I always come back to a bunch of markdown files inside a Git repo.
![Image 30](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097607&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)> And somehow I always come back to a bunch of markdown files inside a Git repo. Others have mentioned this but if you want to keep this workflow, the best app I've found is Obsidian + Git Plugin. It works fantastically well on desktop though it does require a little work to get it working on iOS.
![Image 31](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097762&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Are there options to see the current state of the repo? What I mean is, for example, I like that in VS Code I instantly know the current state because the git sidebar icon shows a notification of uncommitted changes. If I don't have a visual reminder, I'm more likely to not make commits when I should, and I also don't want an auto-committer firing after each change. I find the visual reminder keeps me anchored to my git status. Heck, maybe I should just use code for notes. One plus would be web access with code server, since Obsidians only docker image that I know of uses VNC. Anyone compared these two tools and have a decent write up? The biggest item which comes to mind would be referencing other notes and the features built on top of that?

![Image 32](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44101013&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)> Others have mentioned this but if you want to keep this workflow... If I want to keep this workflow why shouldn't I just continue using this same workflow?

![Image 33](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098353&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)There are a couple methods - I use Working Copy to manage the git stuff on iOS. Far from perfect, but it works.
![Image 34](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098665&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)a-shell is another way you can do this. Takes a bit of finagling to set up and wire in plugins and the like but is relatively stable afterward.
![Image 35](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44096483&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)Compared to something with automatic bidirectional sync between all devices, something where one has to manually commit/push/pull a new/edited note feels archaic.
![Image 36](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097020&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)OTOH you get version history, with commit messages if you care to write them. And the full power of git to explore the history. You can edit the same file on two (offline) devices, then resolve the inevitable merge conflict. "Automatic bidirectional sync between all devices" scares me. How does it deal with merge conflicts? How am I sure I'll be able to revert to a previous version? Can I see the full history of a file? I don't know, perhaps it'd be ok. I certainly wouldn't learn git just for note taking! But, I know how to use my hammer, so everything look like a nail...
![Image 37](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097609&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)But you can still have the full power of git with Obsidian still, since they're just MD files at the end of the day.
![Image 38](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44096799&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)You can automate commits and push on save. I had a similar setup for vimwiki before migrating to a web-based wiki system (dokuwiki).
![Image 39](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44097212&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I thought it would be a problem as well but it turns out I absolutely never edit my notes on two machines at once. The commit/push/pull is done via a simple bash script that I'm running as a build command inside VS Code.
![Image 40](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44099471&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I like it as I consciously enjoy sort of checking in. I also store in a onedrive folder for automatic sync and backup in case I have a crash before I do a git commit.

![Image 41](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44102739&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)No webpage. No screenshots. Not even Releases? I'm not trying this app. The readme is more about the technical details of the code than the actual features of the app. Where do I go to see what this thing can actually do? Do people expect me to run the program just to see if I want to run the program?

![Image 42](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44105688&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I did take a look at that, which is probably more than most people would have done, and by take a look I mean a skimmed for images because I'm not reading 2000 words of text for an app I don't even use yet. The only images I found showed how drag and drop works. I know this is common with projects that think Github is a replacement for a website, but I genuinely wonder how does it get so bad that a 5 year project with 9000 commits and 60 contributors doesn't have a single screenshot. Nothing personal or particular about this project specifically, just... the whole open source culture of dropping something on Github and not even doing the bare minimum to have other people get to know the project. It feels like such a waste. It could be an amazing project but who is going to bother with it if they can't see what it looks like?
![Image 43](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44096356&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)For me, it's the same way, except that instead of Markdown, I use plain org-mode files sprinkled with a bit of org-roam tags when needed.
![Image 44](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098190&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I oscillate between Apple Notes and a bunch of markdown files, which is a pretty painful thing to do. I like how future proof a folder of markdown files is. But I like the design, simplicity, and deep features for capture and media support offered in Apple Notes. The more a markdown app supports extra stuff, the more proprietary it starts to feel, as any app to read it will also need to support those things. A while back I told myself I was going to stick to Apple Notes, as going back and forth to other things is painful, and doing it proactively means more pain, rather than maybe having some pain in 10 years of the app goes away. However, where I am again, in the middle of a largely manual migration back to Obsidian for my folder of markdown files. I used an export, but the formatting is so bad that I need to clean up every single note.
![Image 45](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44098638&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)The inability to export, as well as the lack of anything more than the bare basic formatting options (at least at the time a few years ago) pushed me off apple notes.
![Image 46](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44099459&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I’ve been able to export since early, early iPhone. They’re just txt files. Surprisingly, Apple notes have been the most durable as Apple has migrated them from every iPhone I’ve had for the past 15-20 years or whatever. Basic formatting is a plus for me. Although now notes has really advanced formatting and even sketching.

![Image 47](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44102851&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)I ended up using Exporter from the App Store. I didn't work great. I have an export, but there are a lot of issues with it. I'm finding it is often easier to copy the note and use the Rich Text to Markdown action in Shortcuts, then paste into Obsidian. If I spent more time with Shortcuts there is probably a way to automate this way a bit more.

![Image 48](https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif)[](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44099863&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D44094980)There are plenty of tools for exporting, and I’ve tried to leave Notes several times and had no issue getting the notes out. But trouble free sync between machines, the ability to ‘scan’ documents, adding basic maths support, the ease… it always sucks me back in. I wish it kept the date of creation and edits readily available, and supported markdown. But it’s damn close to what I want. Why can’t Apple Mail do search as well as notes?

This makes every app that saves into iCloud files behave like Notes, i.e. work offline with automatic online sync.

I don't want to risk my notes on a configuration error or billing mishap.

When you are debugging some hairy bug, some manager doesn't really want to wade through all the comments to get an idea; an editable summary at the very top of the page communicates high-level points to stakeholders while others continue to comment on details. People work around this by editing the initial comment of the issue but it's better if there's something more dedicated. * Sophisticated access control. More than once when someone writes a bug report they are referring to a bug experienced by a single user. For user privacy reasons there needs to be a per-issue permission system to restrict access beyond the permission implied by the repo. * The ability to add personal notes to an issue without publishing it. Whether it's a draft form of a comment or something else, it gets rid of the need to maintain your own notes.

So instead of spending your time debugging you have to ensure the bug is properly tagged, categorized, has the right version number(s) for affected software, has the right assignee, yadda, yadda. Then some busy beaver will send you email reminding you that you haven't filled in all the drop-downs and check boxes correctly....

Summary It wouldn’t be too hard to add that with a 3rd party plugin. You could set an event hook to run through the comments, and add it to the top comment. For bonus points, you could use an LLM to summarise. Every company loves a bit of AI these days, so your manager can gloat with his manager buddies that you now have AI-powered issue tracking. 2. That sounds like an anti-pattern to me. There shouldn’t be PII in your dev issue tracking system. There problem here isn’t RBAC, it’s the workflow. If you’re in a situation where you need to make notes of sensitive information then you should store that in the same data store as the source information (eg Salesforce, et al). And I say this as someone who hates Salesforce. 3. I’ve not seen this feature in any issue tracker. Sounds like a nice feature but I wouldn’t have thought it as essential.

There shouldn’t be PII in your dev issue tracking system. Then how do you track such issues? I'll give you a real example I've experienced: a high-value customer writes to support and complains that his UI is broken. None of the other people's UIs are broken. Do you not use the issue tracking system just because you need to get that customer's private settings and PII in order to debug the bug? It's common to require PII to be stored elsewhere, but people will still make mistakes and copy paste PII for convenience. In the end isn't it better for your issue tracking system to be flexible enough to store PII?

In my view, centralized structures like a giant source repository such as github are something we as a developer community need to avoid. Unfortunately, features like federated merge requests in gitlab ( [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14116](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14116) ) are something we've been waiting for for 9 years and nothing seems to be happening there. This feature alone would enable a lot of new collaboration without forcing everyone to work on a centralized system to use git - a decentralized versioning system - with high efficiency. Last week, Microsoft cut off the email account of the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, after being ordered to do so by the Trump administration. This is merely a week or two after Microsoft did a big PR campaign, telling the European Union how they were to stand up against this administration if the need arises. The irony! Trump isn't hiding his opinion about the EU. What's stopping him from ordering Microsoft to block the EU from accessing github one day? Right now: Nothing at all. Think about how it would impact your business and open source software in general. We must not put all our eggs in a single basket.
