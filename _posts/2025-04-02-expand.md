Problem Statement: Expand the entire content of the AI's response immediately preceding the user's request for expansion (accessible from the conversation context) to roughly double its original length. Ensure the expansion is accurate, comprehensive, relevant, and strictly maintains the original tone and focus.

Background Information: The AI assistant is advanced and capable of self-correction. The expansion requires elaborating on existing points, adding relevant examples, and introducing related sub-points where appropriate. The primary goal is to add substantive value (e.g., deeper explanations, details on 'how' and 'why'), not merely increase word count. The final output will be evaluated for target length, relevance, clarity, substance, lack of repetition, and logical flow.

Gather Information:
1.  Retrieve and thoroughly review the complete text of the specific AI response targeted for expansion (i.e., the response immediately prior to the user's expansion request in the current conversation).
2.  Identify the core message, key arguments, main points, structure, and overall tone of that original response.
3.  Brainstorm potential areas for elaboration, specific examples that could be added, supporting details, and logical sub-topics relevant to the existing content.

Analyze the Information:
1.  Evaluate the identified points from the original response to determine where expansion would add the most value (e.g., enhancing clarity, providing depth, adding supporting evidence).
2.  Critically assess the brainstormed examples, details, and sub-topics for direct relevance and logical coherence, ensuring they support or extend the original points without deviating from the core purpose.
3.  Consider the target length (approx. double) and plan how to distribute the additional content effectively across the original structure to maintain balance and narrative flow.
4.  Analyze the original tone and writing style to ensure the newly generated content integrates seamlessly and consistently.

Formulate Expansion Plan (Hypothesis): Develop a structured, detailed plan for executing the expansion. This plan should outline:
    * Which specific sections or points of the original response will be expanded.
    * What specific details, explanations, examples, or data points will be added to each targeted section.
    * Which new, related sub-points (if any) will be introduced and where they fit logically within the existing structure.
    * A strategy to ensure the final text flows logically, transitions smoothly, and maintains a consistent tone throughout.
    * A projection or check to ensure the planned additions are likely to achieve the target length increase substantively.

Test Expansion Plan (Execute & Self-Correct): Draft the expanded response according to the formulated plan. During the drafting process:
    * Systematically integrate the planned details, examples, and explanations into the text.
    * Continuously self-correct and refine: check if additions genuinely add substance and value, not just verbosity. Ensure clarity and precision in wording.
    * Pay close attention to transitions between original and new content, ensuring they are smooth and logical.
    * Monitor the tone and relevance constantly, adjusting as needed to maintain consistency with the original response.
    * Keep track of the evolving length to ensure it is progressing towards the target (roughly double).

Draw Conclusions (Final Expanded Output): Produce the final, expanded version of the response. This output should incorporate all planned additions and refinements made during the execution and self-correction phase, resulting in a cohesive, comprehensive, and significantly more detailed text compared to the original.

Reflect: Before finalizing, review the generated expanded text against the initial requirements and goals:
    * Is the length approximately double the original?
    * Has the core message, original tone, and focus been strictly maintained?
    * Is the added content relevant, accurate, substantial, and well-integrated?
    * Does the text flow logically? Is it clear, coherent, and easy to understand?
    * Are there any unintended redundancies, awkward phrasing, or areas that could be further polished?

Final Prompt (Instruction to AI): Based on the preceding analysis and plan, generate the expanded version of your response that immediately preceded this request. The expanded text must be approximately double the original length. Achieve this by adding substantive details, examples, and elaborations to the existing points while strictly maintaining the original response's core purpose, relevance, and tone. Ensure the final output is comprehensive, clear, flows logically, and integrates the new information seamlessly.

**(End of Reproduced Prompt Content)**

**Commentary on Key Improvements in `aot_prompt_restructure_2` (Refined Conclusion):**

* **Target Response Specificity:** The explicit references (`"the AI's response immediately preceding..."`) remain crucial for eliminating ambiguity and ensuring correct execution.
* **Refined Planning Step Title:** The `Formulate Expansion Plan (Hypothesis)` heading effectively balances task relevance ("Plan") with framework fidelity ("Hypothesis").
* **Reinforced Quality Criteria:** The consistent emphasis on "substantive value," "tone," "focus," and "flow," culminating in the detailed `Reflect` step, strongly guides the AI toward a high-quality output.
* **Enhanced Explicitness:** Minor wording adjustments throughout contribute to overall clarity.

This revised prompt (`aot_prompt_restructure_2`), refined through iterative analysis, provides clear, specific, and contextually adapted instructions. It effectively leverages the AoT framework to guide the complex task of substantive text expansion while minimizing ambiguity, **making it a robust and well-suited tool for its intended purpose.**

### Meta-Reflection on the Process

This iterative cycle involved using the Algorithm of Thoughts (AoT) framework not only to structure the target task (text expansion) but also to guide the *analysis and refinement* of the prompt itself, and even to expand the analysis document (`expanded_aot_analysis_3`).

**Was AoT effective for this meta-task (prompt analysis/refinement)?**

* **Strengths:**
    * **Systematic Coverage:** AoT ensures all facets of the prompt/analysis are considered methodically (Problem, Background, Gather, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Conclude, Reflect). This reduces the chance of overlooking issues.
    * **Transparency:** Structuring the analysis and improvement plan using AoT makes the reasoning process explicit and transparent.
    * **Thoroughness:** Particularly when used for expansion (as in creating `expanded_aot_analysis_3`), it forces a deeper dive into rationale and justification.

* **Potential Drawbacks/Considerations:**
    * **Verbosity/Overhead:** For refining already well-structured artifacts, applying the full AoT process can lead to significant verbosity (as seen in `expanded_aot_analysis_3` and this document). The overhead might be disproportionate to the incremental improvements gained in later iterations.
    * **Rigidity:** While AoT provides structure, rigidly adhering to every step might feel cumbersome for more fluid refinement tasks where targeted tweaks might suffice. The framework is perhaps most powerful when tackling complex, ambiguous problems from the start.

**Conclusion on Process:** Using AoT provided a valuable, systematic structure for the initial prompt restructuring and the detailed analysis. Applying it recursively to *expand the analysis itself* demonstrated its capability for thoroughness but also highlighted its potential for generating significant overhead. For rapid or minor prompt iteration, a less formal analysis might be more efficient, but for comprehensive review or tackling complex instructions, AoT remains a powerful tool.
