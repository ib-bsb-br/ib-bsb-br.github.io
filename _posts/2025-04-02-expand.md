Expand the entire content of the AI's response immediately preceding the user's request for expansion (accessible from the conversation context) to roughly double its original length. Ensure the expansion is accurate, comprehensive, relevant, and strictly maintains the original tone and focus.

The AI assistant is advanced and capable of self-correction. The expansion requires elaborating on existing points, adding relevant examples, and introducing related sub-points where appropriate. The primary goal is to add substantive value (e.g., deeper explanations, details on 'how' and 'why'), not merely increase word count. The final output will be evaluated for target length, relevance, clarity, substance, lack of repetition, and logical flow.

1.  Retrieve and thoroughly review the complete text of the specific AI response targeted for expansion (i.e., the response immediately prior to the user's expansion request in the current conversation).
2.  Identify the core message, key arguments, main points, structure, and overall tone of that original response.
3.  Brainstorm potential areas for elaboration, specific examples that could be added, supporting details, and logical sub-topics relevant to the existing content.
4.  Evaluate the identified points from the original response to determine where expansion would add the most value (e.g., enhancing clarity, providing depth, adding supporting evidence).
5.  Critically assess the brainstormed examples, details, and sub-topics for direct relevance and logical coherence, ensuring they support or extend the original points without deviating from the core purpose.
6.  Consider the target length (approx. double) and plan how to distribute the additional content effectively across the original structure to maintain balance and narrative flow.
7.  Analyze the original tone and writing style to ensure the newly generated content integrates seamlessly and consistently.

Develop a structured, detailed plan for executing the expansion. This plan should outline:
    * Which specific sections or points of the original response will be expanded.
    * What specific details, explanations, examples, or data points will be added to each targeted section.
    * Which new, related sub-points (if any) will be introduced and where they fit logically within the existing structure.
    * A strategy to ensure the final text flows logically, transitions smoothly, and maintains a consistent tone throughout.
    * A projection or check to ensure the planned additions are likely to achieve the target length increase substantively.

Draft the expanded response according to the formulated plan. During the drafting process:
    * Systematically integrate the planned details, examples, and explanations into the text.
    * Continuously self-correct and refine: check if additions genuinely add substance and value, not just verbosity. Ensure clarity and precision in wording.
    * Pay close attention to transitions between original and new content, ensuring they are smooth and logical.
    * Monitor the tone and relevance constantly, adjusting as needed to maintain consistency with the original response.
    * Keep track of the evolving length to ensure it is progressing towards the target (roughly double).

Produce the final, expanded version of the response. This output should incorporate all planned additions and refinements made during the execution and self-correction phase, resulting in a cohesive, comprehensive, and significantly more detailed text compared to the original.

Before finalizing, review the generated expanded text against the initial requirements and goals:
    * Is the length approximately double the original?
    * Has the core message, original tone, and focus been strictly maintained?
    * Is the added content relevant, accurate, substantial, and well-integrated?
    * Does the text flow logically? Is it clear, coherent, and easy to understand?
    * Are there any unintended redundancies, awkward phrasing, or areas that could be further polished?

Based on the preceding analysis and plan, generate the expanded version of your response that immediately preceded this request. The expanded text must be approximately double the original length. Achieve this by adding substantive details, examples, and elaborations to the existing points while strictly maintaining the original response's core purpose, relevance, and tone. Ensure the final output is comprehensive, clear, flows logically, and integrates the new information seamlessly.
