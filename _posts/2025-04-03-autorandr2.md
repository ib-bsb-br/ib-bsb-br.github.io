You are a professor using a Raspberry Pi 4B running openSUSE Tumbleweed, and you frequently need to connect your device to various projectors and ultrawide monitors in different classrooms or lecture halls. You have encountered issues where connecting to projectors or ultrawide monitors with uncommon resolutions or aspect ratios results in blank screens or graphical glitches. You seek a generic, robust solution that allows your Raspberry Pi to connect seamlessly to most projectors or monitors without manually configuring each device individually. Specifically, you want to avoid repeatedly creating custom resolutions with tools like `xrandr` each time you encounter a new projector or monitor. You are also open to embedding a set of common resolutions or settings into your configuration files to cover at least 80% of the scenarios you might encounter.

You have identified the GitHub project `autorandr` (https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr) as a potential solution. Your task is to refactor your previous response to leverage `autorandr` as the recommended solution to your problem. Your revised response should clearly explain how `autorandr` addresses your issue, provide step-by-step instructions for installation and configuration on openSUSE Tumbleweed, and outline how to use it effectively in your scenario. Ensure your response is clear, accurate, comprehensive, and professionally presented.

## Leveraging `autorandr` for Seamless Projector and Monitor Connections on Raspberry Pi 4B (openSUSE Tumbleweed)

### Why Use `autorandr`?

`autorandr` is a robust, automated tool designed to manage multiple display configurations effortlessly. It automatically detects connected displays and applies pre-saved configurations, eliminating the need for manual adjustments each time you connect to a new projector or monitor. This makes it ideal for professors who frequently move between classrooms and lecture halls with varying display setups.

### Key Benefits for Your Scenario:

- **Automatic Detection:** Automatically selects the correct display configuration based on connected devices.
- **Ease of Use:** No need to manually run `xrandr` commands each time you connect to a new projector or monitor.
- **Flexibility:** Easily save and manage multiple display profiles covering common projector and monitor resolutions.
- **Robustness:** Handles common issues like EDID detection failures gracefully.

## Step-by-Step Installation and Configuration on openSUSE Tumbleweed:

### Step 1: Install `autorandr`

`autorandr` is available via the openSUSE Build Service. Install it using `zypper`:

```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:phillipberndt/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:phillipberndt.repo
sudo zypper refresh
sudo zypper install autorandr
```

Alternatively, you can install via `pip`:

```bash
sudo pip install autorandr
```

### Step 2: Create and Save Display Profiles

Initially, connect your Raspberry Pi to a projector or monitor with a common resolution (e.g., 1920x1080) and configure it manually once using your desktop environment's display settings or `xrandr`. Then save this configuration as a profile:

```bash
autorandr --save common
```

Repeat this step for other common setups you encounter, naming each profile clearly (e.g., `ultrawide`, `projector`, `lecturehall`):

```bash
autorandr --save ultrawide
autorandr --save projector
```

### Step 3: Verify Saved Profiles

Check your saved profiles:

```bash
autorandr --list
```

### Step 4: Test Automatic Detection

Connect your Raspberry Pi to a previously configured projector or monitor and run:

```bash
autorandr --change
```

`autorandr` will automatically detect the connected display and apply the correct profile.

### Step 5: Enable Automatic Execution on Display Changes

To automate this process completely, enable `autorandr` to run automatically when displays are connected or disconnected:

- **Using systemd (recommended):**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable autorandr.service
sudo systemctl start autorandr.service
```

- **Using udev (alternative method):**

Ensure the udev rule is installed (usually done automatically):

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Now, whenever you connect or disconnect a display, `autorandr` will automatically apply the correct profile.

## Advanced Usage and Customization:

### Default Fallback Profile

If no matching profile is found, you can specify a default fallback profile:

```bash
autorandr --default common
```

### Wildcard EDID Matching (Advanced)

For even greater flexibility, you can use wildcard EDID matching to create generic profiles that match multiple similar projectors or monitors. Edit the EDID strings in your saved profiles (`~/.config/autorandr/<profile>/setup`) and replace specific EDID values with wildcards (`*`) to match similar devices.

Example (`~/.config/autorandr/projector/setup`):

```
HDMI-1 00ffffffffffff00*
```

This will match any projector connected to HDMI-1 with a similar EDID pattern.

## Troubleshooting and Verification:

- **List Detected Profiles:**

```bash
autorandr --detected
```

- **Debugging Mode:**

If you encounter issues, run `autorandr` in debug mode:

```bash
autorandr --change --debug
```

This provides detailed output to help diagnose issues.

## Summary:

By leveraging `autorandr`, you can seamlessly manage multiple projector and monitor configurations without manual intervention. Simply save common display setups once, and `autorandr` will automatically detect and apply the correct configuration whenever you connect your Raspberry Pi 4B to a new projector or monitor. This solution significantly simplifies your workflow, allowing you to focus on teaching rather than troubleshooting display issues.
