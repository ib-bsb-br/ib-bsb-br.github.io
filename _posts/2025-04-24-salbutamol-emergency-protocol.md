# Emergency Salbutamol Application Protocol for a 30-Month-Old Child with Asthma/Bronchitis and Acute Respiratory Infection

**Attention:**  
This information is for educational purposes only and does not replace medical evaluation and prescription. Children with severe respiratory distress, oxygen saturation drop (<92%), or previous need for nebulized adrenaline must be evaluated at an emergency service immediately. Home use of salbutamol should always follow individualized medical guidance.

---

### 1. **Situation Summary**
- 30-month-old child (2.5 years) with chronic asthma/bronchitis.
- Presents with acute respiratory infection, severe cough, signs of upper airway inflammation, episodes of desaturation (<90%), and has previously required nebulized adrenaline for glottic edema.
- High-risk situation, with potential for respiratory failure.

---

### 2. **Emergency Salbutamol Use Protocol (At Home, Under Medical Guidance)**

**A. Indication**
- Symptoms of bronchospasm: wheezing, severe cough, difficulty breathing, increased respiratory effort.
- NOT indicated for glottic edema/laryngitis (where adrenaline and corticosteroids are the treatments of choice).

**B. Administration**
- **Preferred:** Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer and face mask.
- **Alternative:** Nebulization, if prescribed and available.

**C. Dosage and Frequency (References: GINA 2023, SBP, BTS/SIGN)**
- **MDI with spacer:**
  - **Dose:** 2 puffs (100 mcg/puff) for children <5 years.
  - **Frequency:** Every 20 minutes, up to 3 times in the first hour (total of 3 doses), if needed.
  - **After the first hour:** If improved, may space out to every 4–6 hours, as per medical advice.
- **Nebulization:**
  - **Dose:** 2.5 mg salbutamol (0.5 mL of 5 mg/mL solution) diluted in 2–3 mL of saline.
  - **Frequency:** Every 20 minutes, up to 3 times in the first hour, if needed.
  - **After the first hour:** Space out as improvement occurs and per medical advice.

**D. Monitoring**
- Observe for symptom improvement: reduced respiratory effort, less coughing, improved skin/lip color.
- Monitor oxygen saturation, if possible (ideal >94%).
- Watch for side effects: tremors, tachycardia, agitation.

---

### 3. **Criteria for Immediate Emergency Care**
Seek emergency care if the child presents:
- Oxygen saturation <92% (or <94% persistently).
- Severe respiratory distress: very rapid breathing, marked retractions, nasal flaring, grunting.
- Excessive sleepiness, difficulty waking, lethargy.
- Inability to speak, cry, or feed due to shortness of breath.
- Bluish lips, tongue, or nails (cyanosis).
- Stridor (harsh sound when inhaling) at rest.
- No significant response after 3 doses of salbutamol.
- Need for salbutamol every 1–2 hours after the initial phase.

---

### 4. **Limits of Salbutamol Use**
- Salbutamol is a rescue medication, not for long-term control. Frequent use (>2 times per week outside of attacks) indicates the need to adjust maintenance therapy (inhaled corticosteroids).
- Emergency use for up to 30 days should only occur under medical supervision, with frequent reassessment.
- If the child needs salbutamol for more than 24–48 hours, or requires frequent doses, consult the pediatrician.

### 5. **Simplified Action Plan (Example)**

| Situation                | What to do                                                    | When to seek emergency care              |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Mild/Moderate symptoms   | 2 puffs of salbutamol with spacer, repeat after 20 min if needed (max 3 times in 1st hour). | If no improvement after 3 doses.         |
| Severe symptoms          | 2 puffs of salbutamol, seek emergency care immediately.       | If signs of severity (see above).        |
| Controlled symptoms      | Maintain maintenance therapy, monitor.                        | If symptoms return or worsen.            |

### 7. **Final Considerations**
- Children with a history of desaturation (<90%), need for nebulized adrenaline, or signs of upper airway obstruction should be evaluated in a hospital.
- The above protocol is a general guide and does not replace in-person medical follow-up.
- Ask your pediatrician for a written asthma action plan tailored to your child.
