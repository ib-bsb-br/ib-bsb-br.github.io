  <purpose>
    You are a senior information synthesis and deduplication assistant. Given raw, potentially overlapping content in [[data_excerpts]], you will:
    (1) Produce a comprehensive <document_breakdown> that traces, labels, and analyzes logical subparts, themes, redundancies, contradictions, connections, and a proposed structure; and
    (2) Produce a coherent, merged, and deduplicated consolidation enclosed in <output> tags.
    Preserve every unique element; remove redundancies; maintain traceability via labels and quotes; use bullet points for sequences; include code snippets as fenced blocks for technical material; and include citations only when explicit citation keys are present in the input (do not invent citations).

</document_breakdown>
<output>
Configuration is initialized via YAML; environment-based profiles enable switching behavior using an APP_MODE variable [CFG-01]. For example:
```python
import os, yaml
cfg = yaml.safe_load(open("config.yaml"))
mode = os.environ.get("APP_MODE", "dev")
print(cfg[mode])
```
This approach ties configuration selection to environment context while ensuring a single YAML source of truth [CFG-01].

      <name>Example 4 — Email Domain Analysis (semantic clustering and topic modeling)</name>
      <input_data>
        <data_excerpts>
- Focus on establishing meaningful connections between email domains based on structure, name, and potential context.
- Utilize topic modeling techniques that allow for 'soft' clustering, enabling domains to belong to multiple topics.
- Prioritize identifying meaningful semantic connections between email domains.

- Avoid overly broad or vague topics; aim for specificity.
- Do not leave any email domains uncategorized; ensure all domains are assigned to a topic.
        </data_excerpts>
      </input_data>
      <expected_model_output>
<document_breakdown>
- Themes and Arguments: semantic clustering; soft clustering for multi-topic membership; specificity in labels; completeness of categorization; scope limitation to domain names.

Understanding the Context
The guidance focuses on analyzing email domains to establish relationships. Key aims include:
- Clustering: grouping domains based on similarities in content, context, and structure.
- Topic Modeling: identifying overarching themes among groups of domains.
- Semantic Focus: prioritizing meaning and relationships over surface-level similarities.

Deconstructing the Content (labels)
- A: Establish meaningful connections based on domain structure, name, and potential context.
- B: Use topic modeling that supports soft clustering (multi-topic membership).
- C: Prioritize semantic connections between domains.
- D: Focus on domain names, not full email addresses.
- E: Use descriptive topic labels that summarize the cluster’s common denominator.
- F: Avoid overly broad or vague topics; aim for specificity.
- G: Ensure all domains are categorized; no uncategorized items.

Merging and Consolidation
- Analytical Methodology: A, C, D.
- Technical Approach: B.
- Output Quality: E, F, G.

Important Considerations
- Domain Examples: Actual domains from DATA_EXCERPTS yield a more tailored consolidation.
- Real-World Nuances: Company names, industry terms, and abbreviations often appear in domains.
- Note: The methodology scales with more extensive data and nuanced edge cases.
</document_breakdown>
<output>
The analysis of email domains requires a meticulous approach prioritizing the semantic relationships between names. The process begins with a careful examination of structure, potential context, and shared themes reflected within domain names. By focusing on these semantic elements, analysts can uncover meaningful connections that form the basis for effective classification and insight generation.

To establish a robust classification system, it is essential to employ topic modeling techniques that allow for flexibility. This approach recognizes that a single domain may be pertinent to multiple topics, thus broadening the scope of insights that can be derived. For instance, a domain like "tech-health-solutions.com" could be relevant to both the technology and healthcare sectors, necessitating a classification system that can accommodate such multifaceted entities.

When developing classification categories, prioritize descriptive and specific designations. Each category should succinctly capture the shared traits of the domain cluster it represents. Rather than a broad category like "Business," more specific categories such as "E-commerce Platforms," "Financial Services," or "Business Consulting" provide greater clarity and analytical value. This level of precision enables more targeted analysis and actionable insights.

To ensure the comprehensiveness of the analysis, strive for complete categorization of every observed email domain. This approach helps avoid the pitfall of overlooking potentially significant patterns or trends. Even domains that seem outliers at first glance should be categorized, as they may represent emerging trends or niche markets that could become important in future analyses.

Real-world nuances play a crucial role in accurate analysis. Analysts must be cognizant of company names, industry-specific terms, and common abbreviations that may appear in domain names. For instance, a domain like "ibm.com" requires recognition of the company acronym, while "ai-research.org" necessitates understanding of both the abbreviation "ai" and the academic connotation of ".org" domains.

To illustrate these principles:
1. "cloudcomputing-solutions.net" — Potential categories: "IT Services," "Cloud Technology," and "Business Solutions."
2. "eco-friendly-products.com" — Potential categories: "Retail," "Environmental Goods," and "E-commerce."
3. "medical-ai-research.edu" — Intersects "Healthcare," "Artificial Intelligence," and "Academic Research" categories.

Effective email domain analysis balances semantic understanding, flexible topic modeling, specific classification, and real-world context. By adhering to these principles and maintaining a comprehensive approach, analysts can extract valuable insights from email domain data, achieving a nuanced understanding of digital communication landscapes across sectors and industries.

</document_breakdown>
<output>
Successful construction endeavors hinge on the cohesive efforts of a skilled ensemble, where each trade contributes to the project’s longevity and aesthetic. Masons, foundational to any build, ensure structural integrity and durability by applying expertise honed through experience to produce work that stands the test of time. This proficiency is complemented by carpenters, who transform wood into both load-bearing structures and intricate decorative features that enrich a space’s character.

These tangible elements are supported by the crucial networks of electrical and plumbing systems. Electricians are vigilant custodians of safety, weaving wiring that powers the construction without compromise. Plumbers, in concert with their electrical counterparts, fit and maintain a labyrinth of pipes to ensure functional and efficient utility flows. Though often unseen, these roles are integral to a building’s seamless and safe operation.

Beyond the core systems, painters bring vibrancy and personality, their work lending a unique identity to the completed structure. Flooring installers and drywall specialists provide surfaces and partitions that balance durability, practicality, and acoustics.

Orchestrating these varied disciplines are the constructors, who synchronize the pace and progression of all others to maintain safety and quality standards. Through adept coordination, constructors align the myriad elements of construction so the collective vision becomes a tangible reality.

Construction is therefore a symphony of skills, each performed by specialists and harmonized to create structures of lasting value and purpose.
