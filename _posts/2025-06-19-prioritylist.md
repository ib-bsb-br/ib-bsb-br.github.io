#### **How to Use This Framework**

The process involves two key steps: Triage and Strategy.

1. **Triage (The Table Below):** This is the objective assessment phase. For each task, you will assign two scores, removing emotion and focusing on measurable data.  
   * **Impact Level:** Start at Level 10 and work down. The first "Key Question" you can answer with "Yes" determines the task's impact score.  
   * **Effort Score:** Estimate the time required and find the corresponding score on the scale. A crucial part of this is being realistic, not optimistic, about the time commitment.  
2. **Strategy (The Guide Following the Table):** This is the decision-making phase. Once you have the Impact and Effort scores, use the "From Triage to Strategy" guide to decide *how* and *when* to allocate your most valuable resource: your focused time.

### **1\. The Task Triage Summary Table**

Before using the table, perform this crucial **pre-triage step**: for each task, clearly define its **"parent" project or goal.** A task of "Draft email" is low impact on its own, but if its parent is "Secure Series A funding," its context and impact change dramatically. Never score a task in a vacuum.

| Impact Level | Effort (Est. Time) | Key Question |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **10** | \~1 minute | Will delay cause **irreversible parent failure**? |
| **9** | \~5 minutes | Will delay make recovery **prohibitively difficult/costly**? |
| **8** | \~15 minutes | Will delay cause a **significant slip in core resources**? |
| **7** | \~30 minutes | Does delay **completely block other people** from working? |
| **6** | \~1 hour | Does delay **create significant problems or rework** for others? |
| **5** | \~2-3 hours | Are the consequences of delay manageable and absorbable without derailing **parent** **core progress**? **(parent doesn't depend on it, but it adds value)** |
| **4** | \~4-6 hours | Does delay **only cause minor inconvenience for you**? |
| **3** | \~1 day | Is the impact a **trivial, easily-fixed annoyance for you alone**? |
| **2** | \~2-3 days | Would you **barely notice** if this was delayed for another month? |
| **1** | \~4-6 days | Is this a "nice to have" with **no real negative consequence**? |
| **0** | \~1+ weeks | Is this task **irrelevant or obsolete**? |

### **2\. A Deeper Look at Each Impact Level**

#### **Level 10: Catastrophic Harm (Existential Threat)**

* **The Principle:** Delay means the project or goal ceases to exist in its current form. There is no recovery.  
* **Think About:** Legal statutes of limitation, final contract deadlines with no extension, critical safety failures that would end the business.  
* **Example:** A software update has a bug that is actively corrupting all user data. The task to roll back the update is a Level 10 because any delay causes irreversible damage to customer trust and data integrity, from which the company may not recover.

#### **Level 9: Critical Harm (Project Jeopardy)**

* **The Principle:** Delay triggers a crisis. The project can theoretically be saved, but only with an extreme, costly, and disruptive effort that jeopardizes future plans.  
* **Think About:** Losing a "once in a lifetime" opportunity, damage to your reputation that will take years to repair, financial penalties that cripple your budget for the next quarter.  
* **Example:** Forgetting to book a flight for a critical, can't-miss client presentation tomorrow. You *can* still get there by paying an exorbitant last-minute fare and pulling an all-nighter, but the financial cost and personal stress are immense, and you'll perform poorly.

#### **Level 8: Substantial Harm (Major Setback)**

* **The Principle:** Delay causes a major **Resource Drain** (time, money, or scope) that requires formal explanation and adjustment of the project plan.  
* **Think About:** Will this require you to formally report a budget overrun or a change in the delivery date to stakeholders? Does it consume a significant portion (e.g., \>20%) of the project's remaining resources?  
* **Example:** Delaying a decision on a key software library forces an entire development team of five people to pause work for several days. This directly translates to thousands of dollars in wasted salary and a guaranteed slip in the product release date.

#### **Level 7: High Harm (Collaborative Gridlock)**

* **The Principle:** Your delay creates a full stop for someone else. You are a bottleneck, and the cost of your delay is now multiplied by the number of people waiting on you.  
* **Think About:** Is there a person or team whose next action begins with "Wait for \[Your Name\] to finish..."? This is not about making their work harder; it's about making it impossible for them to start.  
* **Example:** You are responsible for providing the final sales numbers to the finance department so they can close the quarterly books. They cannot proceed with their reporting, investor calls, or financial planning until you are done.

#### **Level 6: Moderate Harm (Team Friction)**

* **The Principle:** Your delay creates inefficiency and frustration. It doesn't stop others, but it makes their work harder, forces rework, or lowers their quality. This erodes morale and project velocity.  
* **Think About:** Will someone have to redo their work later because they had to proceed with incomplete information from you? Are you handing off a "known issue" that will cause problems downstream?  
* **Example:** You provide a "draft" version of a document for review, knowing it has errors. Your manager spends an hour reviewing it, but will have to spend another hour reviewing the corrected version later, doubling their effort and disrupting their schedule twice.

#### **Level 5: Tolerable Harm (Quality Debt)**

* **The Principle:** Delay primarily impacts internal quality, standards, and best practices. Accumulating these creates "quality debt" that will have to be paid down later, often at a higher cost.  
* **Think About:** These are the "important, but not urgent" tasks that separate a professional operation from a chaotic one. Refactoring code, improving documentation, organizing files.  
* **Example:** The project's shared document folder is disorganized. It doesn't stop daily work, but it makes finding information slightly slower for everyone, every time they look. Delaying the cleanup is tolerable today, but over a year, it costs hundreds of hours of wasted team productivity.

#### **Levels 4-3: Minor Harm (Personal Clutter)**

* **The Principle:** The negative impact is contained entirely to you and your personal workflow. These tasks are often a source of "productive procrastination."  
* **Think About:** These tasks add to your mental load and create a feeling of being busy without generating real impact. They do not affect anyone else or the project's bottom line.  
* **Example:** (L4) Your email inbox is overflowing, causing you minor stress. (L3) Your desktop has a few extra files that need to be sorted into the correct folders.

#### **Levels 2-0: Negligible Harm (Backlog Noise)**

* **The Principle:** These items are not real, actionable tasks and should be aggressively challenged and removed to create clarity. A bloated backlog is the enemy of focus.  
* **Think About:** Does this item represent a vague idea, an optional exploration, or an outdated concept? If you deleted it right now, would anyone notice in a month?  
* **Example:** (L2) A task to "Explore new note-taking apps" when your current system works. (L1) A vague idea to "Learn more about marketing." (L0) A task to "Prepare for Q2 meeting" when it's now Q4.

# **\======================================== TASK TRIAGE & STRATEGY FRAMEWORK**

## **HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK**

The process has two key steps: Triage  
and Strategy.

1. Triage (Objective Assessment)  
   Assign two scores to each task:  
   * Impact Level: Start at Level 10  
     and work down. The first "Yes"  
     to a Key Question sets the score.  
   * Effort Score: Realistically  
     estimate the time required.  
2. Strategy (Decision-Making)  
   Use your scores with the guide to  
   decide how and when to act.

## **PRE-TRIAGE STEP: DEFINE PARENT GOAL**

Before scoring, define the "parent"  
project or goal for each task. The  
impact of a task depends on its  
parent's importance. Never score a  
task in a vacuum.

# **\======================================== DEEPER LOOK: IMPACT LEVELS**

## **\--- LEVEL 10 \--- Title: Catastrophic Harm (Existential Threat) Effort: \~1 minute Principle: Delay means the project or goal ceases to exist. There is no recovery. Think About: Legal deadlines, final contract dates, critical safety failures. Example: A software bug is actively corrupting all user data. Rolling it back is Level 10 because delay causes irreversible damage.**

## **\--- LEVEL 9 \--- Title: Critical Harm (Project Jeopardy) Effort: \~5 minutes Principle: Delay triggers a crisis. Recovery is possible but extremely costly and disruptive. Think About: Losing a "once in a lifetime" opportunity, major reputation damage. Example: Forgetting to book a flight for a critical client presentation tomorrow. You can go, but at immense financial and personal cost.**

## **\--- LEVEL 8 \--- Title: Substantial Harm (Major Setback) Effort: \~15 minutes Principle: Delay causes a major Resource Drain (time, money, scope) that requires formal explanation. Think About: Will this require you to formally report a budget overrun or a change in delivery date? Example: Delaying a key software decision forces a team of five to pause work for days.**

## **\--- LEVEL 7 \--- Title: High Harm (Collaborative Gridlock) Effort: \~30 minutes Principle: Your delay creates a full stop for someone else. You are a bottleneck. Think About: Is there a person whose next action is "Wait for \[Your Name\] to finish..."? Example: Finance cannot close the quarterly books until you provide the final sales numbers.**

## **\--- LEVEL 6 \--- Title: Moderate Harm (Team Friction) Effort: \~1 hour Principle: Your delay creates inefficiency and frustration. It forces rework and lowers quality. Think About: Will someone have to redo their work because they had incomplete info from you? Example: Providing a draft with known errors forces your manager to review it twice, doubling their effort.**

## **\--- LEVEL 5 \--- Title: Tolerable Harm (Quality Debt) Effort: \~2-3 hours Principle: Delay impacts internal quality and best practices. This creates "quality debt" to be paid later. Think About: The "important, but not urgent" tasks like refactoring code or organizing files. Example: A messy shared folder makes finding info slow, costing hundreds of hours of productivity over a year.**

## **\--- LEVELS 4-3 \--- Title: Minor Harm (Personal Clutter) Effort: \~4-6 hours (L4), \~1 day (L3) Principle: The negative impact is contained entirely to you and your personal workflow. Think About: These tasks add mental load but don't generate real impact. Example: (L4) A messy inbox. (L3) Desktop files that need sorting.**

## **\--- LEVELS 2-0 \--- Title: Negligible Harm (Backlog Noise) Effort: Days to Weeks+ Principle: These items are not real, actionable tasks and should be aggressively removed. Think About: If you deleted it right now, would anyone notice in a month? Example: (L2) "Explore new note apps." (L1) "Learn about marketing." (L0) "Prep for Q2 meeting" (in Q4).**
