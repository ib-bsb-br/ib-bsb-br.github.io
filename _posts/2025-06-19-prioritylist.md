| Level | Meaning (Harm of Delay) | Concrete Example (Personal & Professional) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 10 | **Catastrophic Harm:** Causes failure of a primary goal, a legal/contractual breach, or irreversible damage. | "Paying my income taxes on the final deadline day to avoid severe legal and financial penalties." |
| 09 | **Critical Harm:** Jeopardizes a major project or milestone; recovery would be extremely difficult and costly. | "Submitting a grant proposal right before the portal closes; a delay means 100% failure of the application." |
| 08 | **Substantial Harm:** Will cause a significant, measurable slip in budget or timelines for a key project. | "If I don't book flights for the wedding this week, the price will double, impacting the entire trip's budget." |
| 07 | **High Harm:** Will directly block other people or other dependent tasks from proceeding. | "I need to send my financial documents to the accountant so they can begin working on my tax return." |
| 06 | **Moderate Harm:** Creates tangible problems or friction for others, but doesn't fully block them. | "If I don't finish the quarterly report draft, my manager can't review it before their vacation." |
| 05 | **Tolerable Harm:** The consequences of delay are manageable and can be absorbed without derailing a project. | "Postponing my routine dental check-up by a few weeks. It's important, but not immediately urgent." |
| 04 | **Minor Harm:** Causes a personal or minor inconvenience but does not impact others or core progress. | "Replying to a non-urgent email from a colleague asking for an opinion." |
| 03 | **Slight Harm:** The negative impact is small, easily rectified, and affects only you. | "Organizing my desktop's digital files. It's cluttered, but I can still find what I need." |
| 02 | **Negligible Harm:** The consequences are barely perceptible; it has no material effect on anyone's work. | "Sorting through old clothes for donation. The pile can sit in the closet for another week." |
| 01 | **Insignificant Harm:** A "nice to have" with no deadline and no discernible negative consequence if delayed. | "Brainstorming potential vacation ideas for next year." |
| 00 | **No Harm:** The task is likely irrelevant or outdated. Delay causes zero negative impact. | "A task to research a product that I've already purchased or decided against." |
