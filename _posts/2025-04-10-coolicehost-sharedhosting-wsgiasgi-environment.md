1.  **CloudLinux OS + Python Selector:** This is the software managing your Python applications.
2.  **Web Server Stack:** You have an **Apache + Nginx (as a reverse proxy)** combination.
    *   **Nginx (Frontend):** Handles incoming requests first. It serves static files directly and acts as a reverse proxy for dynamic content.
    *   **Apache (Backend):** Receives proxied requests from Nginx for dynamic content (like your Python app).
    *   **mod_passenger (within Apache):** This Apache module is responsible for actually launching and managing your Python WSGI application based on configuration found (usually) in `.htaccess` files.
3.  **Configuration Flow:**
    *   You configure your app in the DirectAdmin Python Selector interface.
    *   This tool *should* automatically configure **both**:
        *   **Nginx:** To proxy requests for your `Application URL` (`/mywsgitest`) to the backend Apache server.
        *   **Apache:** By creating/managing the `.htaccess` file within the appropriate web root directory (`public_html` or `private_html`) containing the necessary `mod_passenger` directives (`PassengerAppRoot`, `PassengerBaseURI`, etc.) to tell Apache how to run your app.
