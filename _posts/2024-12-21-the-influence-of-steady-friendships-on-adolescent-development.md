It's the friends they hang out with. If she has at least one real friend with years of friendship, she will be more busy with developing herself and her own future life. Kids that have a new friend every month, because their parents move a lot for example, start to get more trouble. They need to prove themselves and try to get attention, to get a connection and to feel accepted. Spoiler alert: this is not where (pre) teenagers make very good decisions, which is known out of our own experience. Shortcut: a steady, safe living and social base is the key: make sure she hangs out with kids you admire.

**Source:** I have done a short psychology study to understand the troubled kids I worked with as a nurse. I needed to understand where their behaviour came from, because talking is in the beginning impossible for them. But 90% were sexually active.
