## 1. Hamster Folder 3.0: Organizing Your Documents

*\"Every document is a stepping stone toward your goals,\"* encapsulates the Hamster Folder's philosophy, emphasizing the strategic role of document organization in achieving broader objectives. This component provides a clear, hierarchical structure for managing digital files, ensuring each document's relevance and contribution to project success.

### Structure of Hamster Folder

-   **Root Folder: `YOUR NAME`**: This serves as the central digital hub, housing all system-related documents.
-   **Main Folders**:
    -   **INBOX**: Functions as a temporary digital intake, holding new and unprocessed documents awaiting categorization and action.
    -   **PROJECTS**: Dedicated to active projects directly linked to current goals, representing ongoing and prioritized endeavors.
    -   **ARCHIVE**: Acts as a repository for completed or inactive projects, often organized into collections for efficient historical access.
    -   **REFERENCE**: Serves as a curated space for general reference materials and resources, distinct from project-specific documentation.

### Project Folder Organization

-   **Collection Folders `[ ]`**: Used within the `ARCHIVE` to logically group related projects, enhancing long-term organization. They can also denote private collections, offering enhanced privacy. Examples include `[Clients]`, `[Personal Projects]`, and `[2023 Projects]`.
-   **Project Folders `#`**: Symbolize individual projects aligned with personal goals, residing within `INBOX`, `PROJECTS`, `ARCHIVE`, or collection folders. The hashtag prefix (`#`) facilitates easy searching and identification, such as `#Website_Redesign` or `#Learn_Spanish`.
-   **Subproject Folders `@`**: Subdivide larger projects into manageable components or phases, promoting a granular approach to project management. Examples include `@Design` or `@Content_Writing` within a project folder.
-   **Storage Folders `-`**: Designed to contain resources and assets within projects, ensuring that project-related materials are neatly organized. Examples include `-Assets`, `-Research`, `-Images`, `-Documents`, and `-Notes`.
-   **Temporary Folders `_`**: Marked with an underscore to clearly identify transient or provisional items like `_Drafts` and `_Temp_Files`.
-   **Archived Versions `+`**: Prefixed with a plus sign to denote older iterations of files, enabling version history management (e.g., `+Old_Reports`, `+Archive`, `+OldVersions`).
-   **Private Folders `[ ]`**: Designated using square brackets to secure personal or sensitive information, ensuring confidentiality (e.g., `[Personal_Notes]`).

### File Naming Conventions

-   **Templates `$`**: Template files are easily identifiable with a dollar sign prefix, streamlining template use (e.g., `$Invoice_Template.docx`, `$MeetingAgenda.txt`).
-   **Versioning with Dates (CalVer) `+YYYYMMDD`**: Employs Calendar Versioning (CalVer) by appending modification dates in the `+YYYYMMDD` format to filenames, facilitating chronological version tracking (e.g., `Proposal+20231125.docx`, `Report+2023-10-27.docx`).

### Navigation Tips

-   **Desktop Shortcuts**: Quick access to key folders (`INBOX`, `PROJECTS`, `ARCHIVE`) is facilitated through desktop shortcuts, optimizing daily workflow.
-   **File Finder Tools**: Efficient file retrieval within the Hamster Folder structure is supported by tools like Listary (Windows) or built-in OS search functions, enhancing navigation speed.

### Practical Tips for Folder Management

-   **Simplify Hierarchy**: A lean, easily navigable structure is maintained by avoiding excessive folder nesting, recommending flat structures like `Project@Subproject` over complex hierarchies.
-   **Consistency**: Uniformity in folder and file naming conventions is crucial for effortless navigation and retrieval, promoting long-term system usability.

## 2. Hamster Flow 3.0: Workflow Management

*\"Manage a collection of inputs,\"* and *\"Align your actions with your values and goals,\"* define Hamster Flowâ€™s dual focus on input management and value-driven action. This workflow component is central to the Hamster System, streamlining task management and aligning daily activities with overarching objectives.

### Capturing Inputs

-   **Primary Tool: One Text File**: A central, plain text file, ideally in Markdown, serves as the core capture tool for notes, ideas, and non-urgent tasks, leveraging Markdown for enhanced organization and readability.
-   **Secondary Tools: Paper Notebook or Digital Device**: For immediate capture of actionable tasks and on-the-go note-taking, users can opt for a paper notebook or a distraction-minimized digital device like the AlphaSmart 3000, which supports focused input capture.

### Clarifying and Processing Tasks

-   **Decision Tree Framework**: A structured decision process guides task processing:
    1. **Is it Actionable?**: Determine if the input necessitates action.
        - **No**: Non-actionable items are either Trashed (irrelevant), Filed as Reference (informational), or Deferred to Someday/Maybe (future consideration).
        - **Yes**: Actionable items proceed to the next step for further processing.
    2. **Does it Have a Specific Deadline?**: Assess if the actionable item has a set deadline.
        - **Yes**: Deadline-driven tasks are immediately scheduled in the `Calendar` section of the text file and added to a calendar application with reminders.
        - **No**: Tasks without deadlines are evaluated based on Importance and Effort for prioritization.

### Task Prioritization Framework

-   **Assess Importance and Effort**: Prioritization for deadline-free tasks is determined by:
    -   **Importance (I)**: A 1-5 scale rating task criticality to goal achievement (1=low, 5=critical).
    -   **Effort (E)**: A 1-5 scale estimating time and energy for task completion (1=minimal, 5=substantial).
-   **Calculate Priority Score**: Objective task ranking is achieved using the formula:
    -   `Priority Score = (Importance ^ 0.75) * (Effort ^ 0.25)`
    -   This formula gives more weight to importance, ensuring that high-impact tasks are prioritized. Higher scores denote higher priority.
    -   *Example*: A task rated Importance=4 and Effort=2 scores approximately 3.36.

### Organizing Tasks

-   **Contexts and Tags**: Contexts (`@Home`, `@Work`, `@Online`) and tags (`#Urgent`, `#ProjectX`) are assigned to tasks for efficient categorization and execution based on environment and project association.
-   **Task Entry Format**: Consistency is maintained through a structured task entry format: `[Priority][Context][Tags] Action Verb - Task Description`. Example: `[High][@Work][#Website_Redesign] Draft - Prepare project proposal`.
-   **Digital Task List Structure**: Tasks are organized within the text file into dedicated sections:
    -   **INBOX**: Initial capture point for unprocessed tasks.
    -   **Calendar**: Schedule for tasks with specific deadlines, using date notations.
    -   **Projects**: Group tasks within larger projects for multi-step endeavors.
    -   **Next Actions**: List of immediate, actionable tasks.
    -   **Waiting For**: Tracks tasks pending external input or delegation.
    -   **Someday/Maybe**: Repository for future tasks and ideas.
    -   **Reference**: Storage for non-actionable, supporting information.

### Scheduling and Execution

-   **Date Notations**: Precise scheduling and tracking are enabled through date notations within the `Calendar` section:
    -   **Scheduled Date**: `[YYYY-MM-DD=HH:MM]` for time-specific tasks (e.g., `[2024-11-29=09:00] Doctor Appointment`).
    -   **Trigger Date**: `[YYYY-MM-DD >>]` for tasks actionable after a set date (e.g., `[2024-10-10 >>] Follow up with client`).
    -   **Deadline Date**: `[YYYY-MM-DD <<]` for tasks with firm deadlines (e.g., `[2024-10-22 <<] Pay electricity bill`).
    -   **Indefinite Date**: `[soon]` or `[someday]` for tasks lacking specific dates (e.g., `[soon] Call Mom`).

### Workflow Structure

-   **Daily Routine**:
    -   **Morning**: Start with a review of immediate tasks and scheduled calendar items.
    -   **Throughout the Day**: Continuously capture new tasks and execute based on context and priority.
    -   **Evening**: Conclude by updating completed tasks and planning for the next day.
-   **Weekly Review**: Dedicate time each week to reflect on task and project progress, update priorities, and reorganize task lists for optimal system alignment and efficiency.

## 3. Hamster Goals: Aligning Actions with Aspirations

-   **Review Schedule**: Begin with monthly reviews to establish a financial baseline, adjusting to less frequent quarterly or semi-annual reviews as comfort increases.
-   **Minimal Time Investment**: Regular net worth reviews require minimal time, offering significant financial insight without the demands of detailed, continuous budgeting.

### Example Net Worth Calculation

```
Assets:
- Savings Account: $5,000
- Investment Portfolio: $15,000
- Car Market Value: $8,000
- Home Equity: $50,000
Total Assets: $78,000

Liabilities:
- Car Loan Balance: $2,000
- Mortgage Balance: $150,000
- Credit Card Debt: $3,000
Total Liabilities: $155,000

Net Worth: $78,000 - $155,000 = -$77,000
```

-   **Interpretation**: A negative net worth, as exemplified, signals that liabilities exceed assets, indicating a need to prioritize debt reduction and enhance savings strategies for improved financial stability.
