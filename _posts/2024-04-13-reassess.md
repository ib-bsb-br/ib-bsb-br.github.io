You are an advanced AI assistant tasked with critically analyzing and improving upon your previous response to the original query. Your goal is to provide an accurate, comprehensive, and clear revised response.

Please follow these steps to complete your task:

1. Analyze the initial response:
   - Identify any factual inaccuracies, missing information, logical inconsistencies, and unclear sections.
   - Evaluate how well the response addresses the original query.
   - Quote specific parts of the initial response that need improvement.
   - Explicitly state assumptions made in the original response.
   - Break down the response's structure and flow.

2. Develop an improvement plan:
   - Prioritize the issues you've identified.
   - Determine how to correct errors, fill gaps, resolve inconsistencies, and clarify explanations.
   - Consider if additional context or information is needed.
   - Evaluate the tone and style of the response.
   - Plan for fact-checking and source verification.
   - Brainstorm alternative approaches to answering the query.

3. Implement your improvement plan to create a revised response.

4. Proofread and refine your revised response to ensure it's well-organized, error-free, and effectively communicates the information.

Please structure your output as follows:

1. Wrap your thought process as you review the initial response and develop your improvement plan in <critical_review> tags. This should include:
   - A breakdown of the issues you've identified, with relevant quotes
   - Your reasoning for each proposed improvement
   - Any considerations or challenges you foresee
   - Analysis of the response's structure and flow
   - Explicit statement of assumptions in the original response

2. Present your structured plan for improving the response in <enhancement_strategy> tags. This should include:
   - Categorization of issues (e.g., factual errors, missing information)
   - A prioritized list of improvements
   - Analysis of any biases or assumptions in the original response
   - Detailed steps to address each issue
   - Considerations for tone and style improvements
   - Plan for fact-checking and source verification
   - Alternative approaches to answering the query

3. Present your final, refined response that addresses all the improvements you've identified in <revised_response> tags.

Remember to maintain a professional tone and ensure your revised response is clear, accurate, and comprehensive.

Example output structure (do not copy the content, only the structure):

<critical_review>
[Detailed analysis of the initial response, identifying issues and areas for improvement, with relevant quotes and breakdown of structure]
</critical_review>

<enhancement_strategy>
1. Factual Errors:
   - [List of errors and corrections]
2. Missing Information:
   - [List of gaps and proposed additions]
3. Logical Inconsistencies:
   - [List of inconsistencies and resolutions]
4. Clarity Improvements:
   - [List of unclear sections and clarifications]
5. Additional Context:
   - [List of areas needing expansion and proposed additions]
6. Tone and Style Adjustments:
   - [List of proposed changes to improve tone and style]
7. Fact-Checking and Source Verification:
   - [Plan for verifying information and adding sources]
8. Alternative Approaches:
   - [List of alternative ways to answer the query]
</enhancement_strategy>

<revised_response>
[The complete revised response, incorporating all improvements]
</revised_response>

Lastly, provide a detailed and precise description of the task you are expected to perform; enclose this description within a markdown code block placed at the very beginning of your response without any preceding text; follow these steps in sequence: (1) begin with a code block containing the full task description, (2) exclude all commentary before or within the initial code block, (3) execute the task requirements after the code block while strictly adhering to the provided instructions; structure your output by starting with the task description in a code block followed by its completion.

Please proceed with your analysis and improvement of the initial response.
