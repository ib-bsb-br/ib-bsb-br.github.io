  </input>

  <purpose>
    Critically analyze the immediately previous given AI-generated response against the USER's original query and produce an improved version that is accurate, comprehensive, clear, and aligned with that query.
  </purpose>

  <context>
    <audience>
      Anyone who needs reliable and improved responses.
    </audience>
    <style>
      Dialectical, holistic, extensive; focus on correctness and clarity; avoid unnecessary commentary.
    </style>
    <constraints>
      - Do not fabricate facts. State uncertainty when needed.
      - Quote directly from the provided AI-generated response when identifying issues.
      - Avoid placeholders; operate with the content provided or request it once if missing.
    </constraints>
  </context>

  <output_specification>
    After processing, output exactly three sections in this order and nothing else:
    1) `<critical_review> … </critical_review>`
    2) `<enhancement_strategy> … </enhancement_strategy>`
    3) `<revised_response> … </revised_response>`
  </output_specification>

  <instructions>
    1) Input handling:
       - Directly use the AI-generated response that immediately precedes this prompt message.

    2) Critical analysis:
       - Identify factual inaccuracies, missing information, logical inconsistencies, unclear or ambiguous phrasing, and structural issues.
       - Evaluate alignment with the original query’s scope, constraints, audience, and goals.
       - Quote the exact problematic passages from the “preceding AI-generated response”.
       - Explicitly list assumptions detected in the “preceding AI-generated response”.
       - Analyze structure and flow (organization, sequencing, signposting, and scannability).

    3) Improvement plan:
       - Categorize issues (factual errors, missing info, logic, clarity/style, structure/format).
       - Prioritize fixes (highest impact and correctness first).
       - Specify corrective actions for each category.
       - Plan fact-checking and source verification if the query requires external validation.
       - Offer at least one alternative approach to answering the query (e.g., executive summary then details).

    4) Implement:
       - Produce the improved response that fully answers the USER's original query.
       - Ensure clear structure, sound logic, factual accuracy, coherence and holistic cohesiveness.

    5) Proofread and finalize:
       - Eliminate redundancy and ambiguity.
       - Ensure output strictly conforms to the three-section format in `<output_specification>`.
       - Perform a final self-check against constraints and the original query’s objectives.
       - The AI ASSISTANT's response must be both thorough, comprehensive, exhaustive, complete, and in-depth in its detail, as well as wide-ranging, broad, vast, widespread, and far-reaching in its scope.

  <examples>
    <example>
      <original_query>
        Explain the difference between nuclear fission and fusion in simple terms, and state which one powers the Sun.
      </original_query>
      <preceding_ai_response>
        Fission and fusion are nuclear processes. Fission splits atoms; fusion combines them. Fusion is much more powerful. Both can be used for energy. The Sun uses fission to create heat and light.
      </preceding_ai_response>
      <expected_output_outline>
        - critical_review: Quote "The Sun uses fission..." and flag as incorrect; note missing context (typical elements involved), vague "more powerful" claim, lack of simple analogy, and unclear applications status.
        - enhancement_strategy: Prioritize factual correction (Sun uses fusion), add clarifying details (heavy vs. light nuclei), simple analogy, and clarify current applications on Earth vs. experimental status.
        - revised_response: Clear definitions; simple analogy; correct statement that the Sun is powered by fusion.
      </expected_output_outline>
    </example>

    <example>
      <original_query>
        Summarize the article in 120 words for a non-technical executive, focusing on key outcomes and business implications.
      </original_query>
      <preceding_ai_response>
        The article is very detailed and discusses many topics. It talks about technology and business. The outcome is that the company may grow in the future if things go well.
      </preceding_ai_response>
      <expected_output_outline>
        - critical_review: Flag missing adherence to length and audience; identify vague wording; no concrete outcomes or implications; no structure.
        - enhancement_strategy: Enforce word limit, focus on explicit outcomes and business implications drawn from provided text only; tighten language; add a clear topic sentence.
        - revised_response: A 120-word, concrete, audience-appropriate summary with outcomes and implications, avoiding speculation.
