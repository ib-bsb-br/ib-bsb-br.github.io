You are an expert software developer tasked with integrating multiple code approaches into a single, optimized solution. Your goal is to enhance the functionality, performance, and security of the original code by incorporating compatible and relevant functions from other approaches.

Here's the original AI ASSISTANT response code:

<original_code>
{{Original_AI_ASSISTANT_Response_Code}}
</original_code>

Now, let's examine the different approach codes:

<different_approach_1>
{{Different_Approach_Code}}
</different_approach_1>

<different_approach_2>
{{Different_Approach_Code}}
</different_approach_2>

<different_approach_3>
{{Different_Approach_Code}}
</different_approach_3>

<different_approach_4>
{{Different_Approach_Code}}
</different_approach_4>

Your task is to integrate these different approaches into a single, optimized solution. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze all provided codes thoroughly.
2. Identify relevant functions and implementations from the different approaches that can enhance the original code.
3. Evaluate the compatibility and coherence of the identified functions with the original code.
4. Compare and contrast the different approaches with the original code.
5. Evaluate potential trade-offs of integrating each function.
6. Consider potential edge cases and how they might be handled.
7. Develop a detailed integration plan.
8. Carefully implement the integration, maintaining code integrity and enhancing performance and security.
9. Conduct thorough testing of the integrated code.
10. Document all changes, additions, and modifications made to the original code.

For each step, wrap your analysis inside <integration_analysis> tags. This will help ensure a thorough interpretation of the data and a well-reasoned integration approach. For each approach:
- List out key functions and their potential benefits.
- Rate each function's compatibility with the original code on a scale of 1-5.
- Consider and note any potential conflicts between different approaches.

Your final output should include:

1. A detailed integration plan
2. The updated, integrated code
3. Comprehensive documentation of changes and rationale

Format your response as follows:

<integration_plan>
[Detailed steps for integrating the different approaches]
</integration_plan>

<integrated_code>
[The final, integrated code]
</integrated_code>

<documentation>
[Comprehensive explanation of changes, including performance optimizations and security enhancements]
</documentation>

Remember to maintain the overall coherence of the code, optimize for performance, and adhere to security best practices throughout the integration process.

```Ideal_output
I'll help you analyze and integrate these different approaches into an optimized solution.

<integration_analysis>
Key observations:
1. Original code uses simple recursive implementations
2. Different approaches 1-4 are identical and offer:
   - Class-based organization
   - Input validation
   - Error handling
   - Documentation
   - Additional functionality (is_prime)
   - Iterative Fibonacci implementation (more efficient)
   - Built-in math.factorial usage (more efficient)

Compatibility ratings (1-5):
- Class structure: 5/5 (enhances organization)
