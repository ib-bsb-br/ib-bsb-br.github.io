Part 1: Identified Theses
 * The observable universe, through arguments like the Kalam cosmological argument and the argument from contingency, points logically to a transcendent, uncaused, necessary being, which is God.
 * God is a being of pure actuality (actus purus), which means He is fully realized with no unfulfilled potential, and from this, it follows that He is immutable (unchanging).
 * God's character is the objective source of goodness, and His omnipotence serves the right that is inherent to His being, thus resolving the Euthyphro dilemma.
 * The creation of genuinely free beings is the greatest possible expression of divine omnipotence and goodness, not a degradation of God's power.
 * The conflict between divine omniscience and human free will is resolved by God's atemporal nature, as He experiences all of history in a single, eternal "now," knowing our choices without causing them.
 * Evil is not a created substance but a privation or corruption of the good (privatio boni), which entered the world through the misuse of free will.
 * Humanity inherits a fallen state called Original Sin, which is a state of corruption "contracted" rather than "committed," meaning individuals are not personally guilty for Adam's act but are born into a state deprived of original justice.
 * The doctrine of Total Depravity means that sin has corrupted the total person (mind, emotions, will), rendering humans unable to do anything to merit salvation on their own.
 * The Irenaean "soul-making" theodicy explains that God permits suffering in a fallen world as a necessary context for humans to develop profound virtues and grow into His "likeness."
 * Even horrendous evils can be justified from an eternal perspective, as God can redeem them to bring about a "good of such surpassing value" in the afterlife that it justifies the painful means.
 * The Genesis flood was a just and sorrowful divine judgment on pervasive human corruption.
 * The destruction of animals in the flood was a tragic but necessary consequence of their entanglement with a corrupted humanity and the sin-infested world that needed to be remade.
 * The flood's inability to solve the root problem of human sin foreshadows the need for a different, more profound solution—a redemptive act of grace, which the Christian tradition identifies in the atonement offered through Christ.
 * Angels, Satan, and demons are distinct spiritual beings; Satan and the demons are fallen angels who rebelled against God out of pride.
 * Hell is a synthesized state resulting from a soul's free choice for self-exclusion, leading to the experience of God's presence as torment, which constitutes a just punishment.
Part 2: Thesis & Antithesis Pairs
Thesis 1
> The observable universe, through arguments like the Kalam cosmological argument and the argument from contingency, points logically to a transcendent, uncaused, necessary being, which is God.
> 
Antithesis:
> This conclusion rests on philosophically contentious premises and a significant logical leap. The Kalam argument's first premise, "whatever begins to exist has a cause," is an unsubstantiated extrapolation from macroscopic experience. At the quantum level, events without apparent causes are considered possible, and our everyday intuition is a poor guide for cosmology.[1, 2] Furthermore, the concept of "beginning to exist" is ambiguous. The first law of thermodynamics suggests that energy is only transformed, not created ex nihilo. What we observe as "beginnings" are merely rearrangements of pre-existing matter and energy, a fundamentally different category from the absolute origination of a universe.[1, 3] We have no empirical basis for applying a causal rule to the unique event of the universe's origin, as we have never observed one.[3, 4]
> 
> The second premise, "the universe began to exist," is not scientifically settled. While the standard Big Bang model points to a finite past, numerous alternative cosmological models—such as eternal inflation, oscillating or cyclical universes, and steady-state theories—posit a cosmos without a singular beginning.[5, 6, 7] The laws of physics break down at the singularity, making definitive claims about an absolute start speculative.[2, 8]
> 
> Similarly, the argument from contingency relies on the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR), which is a metaphysical assumption, not a proven law. The universe could be a contingent brute fact that simply exists without an ultimate explanation.[9, 10] Applying the PSR to the universe is also subject to the "Taxicab Fallacy," where the principle is used to arrive at a necessary being and then conveniently dismissed, as that being is claimed to require no further explanation.[9, 11]
> 
> Finally, both arguments suffer from the "Gap Problem".[9] Even if one grants the existence of a transcendent cause or a necessary being, there is no logical warrant to identify this cause with the personal, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God of classical theism. The cause could be an impersonal naturalistic mechanism, a multiverse generator, or a set of physical laws beyond our current understanding.[3, 12, 13] The argument does not deduce God; it inserts "God" as a placeholder for the unknown.[2, 14]
> 
Thesis 2
> God is a being of pure actuality (actus purus), which means He is fully realized with no unfulfilled potential, and from this, it follows that He is immutable (unchanging).
> 
Antithesis:
> The doctrine of God as actus purus is a metaphysical construct from Aristotelian physics that becomes incoherent when applied to the personal, interactive God of theism. The very concept of performing an action, such as creating the universe or responding to prayer, implies a transition from a state of non-acting to acting, which is by definition the actualization of a potential.[15] If God is pure act with no potentiality, it is difficult to conceive how He could perform any new act without contradicting His nature. The claim that only the "patient" (creation) changes while the "agent" (God) does not is a problematic assertion that ignores the necessarily reciprocal nature of any interaction.[15, 16]
> 
> This doctrine also leads to the problem of modal collapse. If God is simple, necessary, and identical to His act of willing, then His act of willing to create this specific universe must also be necessary. This implies that this world is the only possible world God could have created, eliminating all contingency from creation and contradicting the notion of divine freedom.[17] The attempt to rescue the doctrine by distinguishing between "active" and "passive" potentiality appears to be an ad hoc refinement to avoid this conclusion, but it struggles to explain how an immutable being can possess an unexercised "active power" without that power itself being a form of potentiality.[17, 18]
> 
> Ultimately, the concept of actus purus risks rendering God a static, inert, and impersonal principle, akin to Aristotle's Unmoved Mover, rather than the dynamic, relational being central to theistic belief.[15, 19] It represents a fundamental tension between the static perfection of a Greek philosophical absolute and the personal God of Abrahamic revelation, suggesting the doctrine is a philosophical importation that creates more theological problems than it solves.
> 
Thesis 3
> God's character is the objective source of goodness, and His omnipotence serves the right that is inherent to His being, thus resolving the Euthyphro dilemma.
> 
Antithesis:
> This proposed solution does not resolve the Euthyphro dilemma but merely relocates it. The dilemma can be rephrased to target God's nature: "Is God's nature good because it aligns with an independent standard of goodness, or is it good simply because it is God's nature?".[20, 21] If the former, then goodness remains an external standard to which God conforms, and He is not the ultimate source of morality. If the latter, then morality is ultimately arbitrary. Whatever God's nature happens to be is defined as "good" by fiat. If His nature were what we perceive as cruel, then cruelty would be good.[22] This renders the statement "God is good" a meaningless tautology, equivalent to saying "God is what He is".[23, 24]
> 
> This position fails to escape the charge that morality is contingent and based on a form of "might makes right".[25] If God's nature could have been different, then the entire moral landscape could be different, stripping morality of its necessity.[22] Furthermore, the argument presents an epistemological crisis: how can humans know God's true nature to use it as a standard? Appeals to scripture are fraught with issues of interpretation, contradiction, and authenticity.[24, 26] If we claim to recognize God's nature as good, we must be using an independent, intuitive standard of goodness to make that judgment, which makes God's nature a redundant middleman in our moral reasoning.[26]
> 
> Finally, some theologians argue that applying the category "moral" to God is a mistake. As the creator of the moral law, God is not a moral agent subject to it in the same way humans are. He may be metaphysically good (i.e., perfect in being), but not morally good (i.e., fulfilling duties).[27] This view suggests that grounding human morality in a being who is Himself beyond moral categories is incoherent. The "God's nature" argument is a semantic maneuver that fails to provide a third way out of the dilemma, ultimately collapsing into either divine subjectivism or an independent moral realism.[28]
> 
Thesis 4
> The creation of genuinely free beings is the greatest possible expression of divine omnipotence and goodness, not a degradation of God's power.
> 
Antithesis:
> This claim is a non-obvious value judgment that rests on a contestable hierarchy of goods. The assertion that a world with libertarian free will and its resultant evils is superior to a world of determined "automatons" without suffering is a theological premise, not a logical necessity.[29, 30] A perfectly benevolent God could plausibly prioritize the well-being and happiness of His creatures over their capacity for a specific type of freedom, especially given the horrific cost in suffering that this freedom entails.[31]
> 
> The defense is incoherent because it fails to explain why God, who possesses free will yet is incapable of evil, could not create beings in His own image who are also free but always choose the good.[30, 32] The appeal to concepts like "transworld depravity"—the idea that every possible free creature would sin in some world—is a speculative, ad hoc assertion designed to patch this logical hole, not a proven principle.[33]
> 
> Furthermore, the Free Will Defense is notoriously inadequate in addressing the problem of natural evil. The immense suffering caused by diseases, natural disasters, and animal predation over millions of years has no apparent connection to human moral choices, rendering the defense, at best, a partial and incomplete theodicy.[34, 35] The entire argument also hinges on the existence of libertarian free will, a philosophically contested position. If human actions are determined by antecedent genetic and environmental causes, as determinists and many compatibilists argue, then the foundation of the defense collapses entirely.[34, 36]
> 
Thesis 5
> The conflict between divine omniscience and human free will is resolved by God's atemporal nature, as He experiences all of history in a single, eternal "now," knowing our choices without causing them.
> 
Antithesis:
> The Boethian solution of an atemporal God does not resolve the logical problem of fatalism but merely reframes it while introducing new incoherencies. The core conflict remains: if there is an infallible, eternally fixed truth about a future human action, then that action cannot be free in the libertarian sense. Whether God knows this truth from a point in the past ("foreknowledge") or from a timeless eternity is irrelevant. The existence of a proposition like "It is true that John will freely choose X at time T" being eternally known by God makes it impossible for John to not choose X at T.[37, 38] The future is as unchangeable as the past.
> 
> The spectator analogy fails because a human spectator watches a recorded event that is already past, whereas God's knowledge is of an event that, from the agent's perspective, is yet to occur. His infallible knowledge fixes the outcome.[39] This solution also creates a profound metaphysical chasm between God and the world. It is difficult to conceive how a completely immutable, timeless being can know or interact with a changing, temporal sequence of events without that knowledge implying some form of sequence within the divine mind itself. This view sacrifices divine immanence and a dynamic relationship with creation—core tenets of theism—to preserve a specific model of omniscience.[39]
> 
> A more coherent, though theologically revisionist, approach is to redefine omniscience as "knowledge of all that is logically possible to know".[38, 40] In this view, future free actions are not yet determined facts, so there is no truth about them to be known. God's inability to know an unknowable future would not compromise his omniscience. The atemporal solution, by contrast, is a feat of abstraction that fails to solve the fatalism problem and does so at the cost of making God's relationship with the temporal world unintelligible.
> 
Thesis 6
> Evil is not a created substance but a privation or corruption of the good (privatio boni), which entered the world through the misuse of free will.
> 
Antithesis:
> The privation theory of evil is an inadequate metaphysical redefinition that fails to account for the reality of evil as experienced. While the theory may work for concepts like darkness being the absence of light, it fails dramatically with phenomenal evils such as pain or cruelty. The evil of pain is not merely the absence of health or pleasure; it is a distinct, positive, and intrinsically bad phenomenological experience.[41, 42] Likewise, cruelty is not just a lack of compassion but a positive volition to take pleasure in another's suffering.[42] The theory contradicts lived experience by redefining these positive states as mere lacks.
> 
> The theory is also philosophically biased. As Bertrand Russell argued, one could just as easily claim that good is the privation of evil (e.g., health is the absence of sickness).[43] The theory's insistence on the primacy of "good" is not derived from neutral observation but from a pre-existing theological commitment: that a good God created all being as good, and therefore evil must not be a "being." It thus begs the question by defining evil in a way that is required to absolve God of its creation.[41, 43]
> 
> By defining evil as a mere "lack" or "corruption," the theory risks trivializing its horrific reality. To describe an event like the Holocaust or the agony of a child with cancer as a "privation of good" is a philosophical understatement that fails to capture the substantive, destructive power of evil.[44, 45] Ultimately, the privation theory is not an empirical description of evil but a piece of theological damage control, prioritizing metaphysical consistency with a pre-accepted doctrine over phenomenological accuracy.
> 
Thesis 7
> Humanity inherits a fallen state called Original Sin, which is a state of corruption "contracted" rather than "committed," meaning individuals are not personally guilty for Adam's act but are born into a state deprived of original justice.
> 
Antithesis:
> The doctrine of Original Sin is predicated on a literalist interpretation of Genesis that is scientifically and historically untenable. Modern evolutionary biology and genetics have demonstrated conclusively that human beings did not descend from a single ancestral pair, but from a population of thousands. This scientific fact invalidates the historical basis for a literal Adam and Eve, breaking the causal chain of inherited sin that the doctrine requires.[46, 47]
> 
> Even if the story were historical, the doctrine is morally unjust. The concept of being born into a corrupted state and deprived of grace because of the actions of a distant ancestor violates fundamental principles of justice, which hold individuals responsible only for their own actions and choices.[47, 48] Attributing guilt or a corrupted status to descendants for the sins of their progenitors is a form of collective punishment that is ethically indefensible. It makes God the author of an unjust system where individuals are condemned for a condition they did not choose and could not avoid.[47, 48]
> 
> The distinction between "contracted" corruption and "committed" guilt is a semantic attempt to soften this injustice, but it fails. If a person is born into a state that inevitably leads to sin and separation from God, they are being punished for the circumstances of their birth. This doctrine functions not as a defensible account of human nature or divine justice, but as a necessary theological mechanism to establish a universal problem (sin) for which a specific theological solution (atonement) is required.
> 
Thesis 8
> The doctrine of Total Depravity means that sin has corrupted the total person (mind, emotions, will), rendering humans unable to do anything to merit salvation on their own.
> 
Antithesis:
> The doctrine of Total Depravity, particularly in its stronger forms, is epistemologically self-defeating and empirically questionable. If the human mind is so thoroughly corrupted by sin that it is "utterly indisposed... and made opposite to all good" that relates to God, then it creates a crippling epistemological problem: how can a depraved mind reliably interpret scripture to arrive at the true doctrine of its own depravity? The doctrine undermines the very faculty required to believe it, making its justification circular or reliant on a special pleading for divine intervention that cannot itself be rationally verified.[49]
> 
> The doctrine also grates against common human experience. We routinely observe non-religious individuals performing acts of genuine kindness, altruism, and love.[50] To dismiss these acts as having no moral worth before God because they do not "proceed from faith" is a theological redefinition of "good" that contradicts our shared moral intuitions.[51] The qualifications often added to the doctrine—that it doesn't mean people are as evil as they could be, but that sin affects every part of them—appear to be ad hoc adjustments designed to reconcile the stark theological claim with the empirical reality of human behavior.[50, 52]
> 
> Finally, if Total Depravity means humans are morally unable to choose God without a prior, irresistible act of divine grace, it effectively negates the libertarian free will that other theological arguments, such as the Free Will Defense, depend upon. It posits a humanity that is not free in the most crucial spiritual sense, thereby making God directly responsible for who is and is not saved, which calls into question both human responsibility and divine fairness.[50, 51]
> 
Thesis 9
> The Irenaean "soul-making" theodicy explains that God permits suffering in a fallen world as a necessary context for humans to develop profound virtues and grow into His "likeness."
> 
Antithesis:
> The soul-making theodicy fails because it cannot justify the quantity, quality, or distribution of suffering in the world. A significant amount of suffering is dysteleological, or purposeless, in that it does not build character but crushes it.[53, 54, 55] The agony of an infant dying from a painful disease, the slow erasure of personality through dementia, or the spiritual destruction of a victim of extreme trauma do not result in moral growth; they are purely destructive.[54]
> 
> The theodicy is particularly weak when confronting horrendous evils. To suggest that events like the Holocaust or the systematic torture of the innocent serve as a context for "soul-making" is morally grotesque.[44, 56] Such evils are so profound that they seem to defeat the entire value of a person's life, making any appeal to character development seem trivial and insulting.[57, 56]
> 
> Furthermore, this framework cannot account for the billions of years of horrific animal suffering that occurred long before humans existed. Animals are not moral agents capable of developing virtues like compassion or faith, so their suffering from predation, disease, and natural disasters is entirely gratuitous under this model.[34, 35] The theodicy's instrumental view of evil—recasting it as a tool used by God—inadvertently portrays God as a cosmic utilitarian who is willing to inflict incomprehensible suffering for a future end, a characterization that is ethically indistinguishable from malevolence.[45]
> 
Thesis 10
> Even horrendous evils can be justified from an eternal perspective, as God can redeem them to bring about a "good of such surpassing value" in the afterlife that it justifies the painful means.
> 
Antithesis:
> This claim is a speculative, unfalsifiable assertion that instrumentalizes extreme suffering in a morally perilous way. The appeal to a future, "surpassing good" to justify present horrors is a form of divine utilitarianism that suggests God uses horrific means to achieve His ends. If a human agent were to inflict torture on a child with the justification that it would eventually lead to a greater good for that child, we would rightly condemn that agent as morally monstrous.[45, 56] The argument asks us to accept a divine morality that is fundamentally alien to our own deepest ethical intuitions.
> 
> The problem of horrendous evil is precisely that the suffering involved is so destructive that it appears to defeat the value of a person's life, making it difficult to conceive of any future good that could "outweigh" or "justify" it.[57, 56] The argument does not remove the horror but rather suggests that God is willing to permit it as part of a plan. This does not solve the problem of evil; it deepens it by implicating God's character directly in the permission of atrocities. Without a clear, coherent account of how such redemption works and why it is necessary, the appeal to a "surpassing good" functions as an empty promissory note offered in the face of incomprehensible pain.
> 
Thesis 11
> The Genesis flood was a just and sorrowful divine judgment on pervasive human corruption.
> 
Antithesis:
> The Genesis flood narrative, when evaluated ethically, describes an act of disproportionate and indiscriminate collective punishment that is irreconcilable with the concept of a just and benevolent being. The story depicts a global genocide that annihilates nearly all of humanity, including infants, children, and any potentially righteous individuals outside of Noah's immediate family, for the sins of a corrupt generation.[58, 59] This is the ultimate form of collective punishment, a concept modern ethics deems abhorrent.[35, 60]
> 
> The claim that the act was "sorrowful" does not mitigate its injustice.[61] An omnipotent and omniscient being who designs a world, foresees its corruption, and then responds with omnicide cannot be absolved by an expression of grief. Furthermore, the narrative itself demonstrates the futility of the act. Genesis 8:21 explicitly states that after the flood, the human heart's inclination is still evil, revealing the cataclysm as a tragic and ineffective failure that did not address the root problem.
> 
> Finally, the story is scientifically impossible. The geological, biological, and archaeological records contain no evidence for a global flood. The logistics of the ark—housing all species, managing food and waste, and explaining the subsequent genetic diversity—are insurmountable.[62, 63] Attempting to defend the flood as a "just judgment" is an effort to sanitize a primitive myth of divine wrath, but the story's core elements remain ethically indefensible and factually baseless.
> 
Thesis 12
> The destruction of animals in the flood was a tragic but necessary consequence of their entanglement with a corrupted humanity and the sin-infested world that needed to be remade.
> 
Antithesis:
> This justification for the mass destruction of animal life is ethically vacuous. Animals are not moral agents; they cannot sin, nor can they be "morally contaminated by association".[58] Their annihilation in the flood represents the slaughter of countless innocent beings. An omnipotent God could have easily preserved animal life without a global flood or selectively protected them from its effects. Choosing to drown them alongside humanity is an act of gratuitous cruelty, not a tragic necessity.
> 
> The argument that they were part of a "sin-infested world" that needed to be remade is a theological rationalization that lacks moral force. It treats animal life as having no intrinsic value, existing merely as disposable stage-dressing for the human drama. This view is inconsistent with a creator who is supposedly benevolent toward all of His creation. The mass death of animals in the flood narrative is not a defensible consequence but a stark example of the story's primitive and brutal ethical framework.
> 
Thesis 13
> The flood's inability to solve the root problem of human sin foreshadows the need for a different, more profound solution—a redemptive act of grace, which the Christian tradition identifies in the atonement offered through Christ.
> 
Antithesis:
> This interpretation frames a narrative failure as a deliberate literary success, an argument that is both post hoc and theologically problematic. It suggests that an omniscient God enacted a global genocide, knowing it would fail, simply to serve as a literary device to "foreshadow" a future plan. This portrays God as a cosmic dramatist willing to use real, catastrophic suffering as a plot point. It does not resolve the ethical problem of the flood but compounds it by assigning it a purpose that is trivial in comparison to the scale of the destruction.
> 
> Rather than being a clever foreshadowing, the flood's failure more directly illustrates the bankruptcy of solving moral problems with overwhelming violence. It is a testament to the story's own internal logic that such a cataclysm could not change the human heart. To read this clear failure as a subtle success is to engage in hermeneutical gymnastics designed to salvage a morally and historically indefensible text for a later theological system.
> 
Thesis 14
> Angels, Satan, and demons are distinct spiritual beings; Satan and the demons are fallen angels who rebelled against God out of pride.
> 
Antithesis:
> This literal interpretation ignores the clear historical and mythological development of these figures. The concept of "Satan" (from the Hebrew ha-satan) evolved significantly over time. In early texts like the Book of Job, he is a subordinate member of God's heavenly court, a "prosecutor" or "adversary" who acts with divine permission.[64, 65] The transformation of this figure into a distinct, purely malevolent cosmic enemy of God shows significant influence from external dualistic traditions, most notably Zoroastrianism, during the Second Temple period.[65, 66]
> 
> Similarly, angels and demons can be understood as mythological personifications of abstract concepts or natural forces. In the transition from polytheism to monotheism, previously independent deities and spirits were demoted and re-categorized as subordinate agents (angels and demons) of the one supreme God.[66] "Demons" often served as ancient explanations for phenomena now understood scientifically, such as physical and mental illness.[67] To insist on a literal interpretation is a category error that mistakes symbolic and evolving mythology for metaphysical fact. The bizarre and contradictory descriptions of these beings in scripture, such as the whirling, multi-faced, eye-covered creatures of Ezekiel, further suggest they are visionary symbols, not literal entities.[68]
> 
Thesis 15
> Hell is a synthesized state resulting from a soul's free choice for self-exclusion, leading to the experience of God's presence as torment, which constitutes a just punishment.
> 
Antithesis:
> This synthesized model of Hell is a logically incoherent and morally monstrous attempt to reconcile conflicting theological demands. It combines three contradictory motivations for Hell: God passively respecting a creature's choice, the impersonal consequence of experiencing love as torment, and God actively inflicting just punishment. A state cannot be simultaneously a freely chosen act of self-exclusion and an externally imposed punitive judgment.
> 
> Regardless of the model, the doctrine of eternal torment remains an indictment of the creator's character. An omnipotent God who designs the entire system, including the rules by which a finite lifetime of choices can lead to an infinite and irreversible state of agony, is the ultimate author of that outcome. A truly omnibenevolent being would not create a reality with such a horrific possibility. The existence of alternatives—such as annihilationism (the soul ceases to exist) or universalism (all are eventually reconciled)—demonstrates that eternal torment is a divine choice, not a logical necessity.
> 
> The psychological premise of the "choice" model is also questionable. The idea that a rational being would freely and eternally choose a state of agonizing torment over bliss is psychologically implausible. This model requires the soul to be both free and yet irrationally locked into a single, self-destructive choice forever. This synthesis is an elaborate rationalization that obscures, but does not solve, the profound moral problem of a good God creating a system that includes the possibility of eternal torture.
