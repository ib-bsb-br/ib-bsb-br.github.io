### EA Sports FC 25 • Two‑Button Controls (Conceptual Map)

> Use **generic names** below; hardware labels differ by platform. Typical equivalence:
> **PASS** ≈ (PlayStation: ✕) / (Xbox: A) | **SHOOT** ≈ (PlayStation: ○) / (Xbox: B)

**Attack**

* **Move/Aim:** Left Stick.
* **PASS (tap):** Short ground pass.
* **PASS (hold):** Longer/lofted pass or lead into space (angle with Left Stick).
* **SHOOT (tap/hold):** Shoot on goal. When wide/in crossing zones, **SHOOT** acts as **cross**.
* **Clearance:** Long **SHOOT** from deep.

**Defense**

* **PASS (tap/hold):** Close down/stand tackle (contain then poke).
* **SHOOT (tap):** Slide tackle (last resort).
* **SHOOT (hold):** Big clearance under pressure.

> Why this mapping? It preserves the **“stand‑tackle first, slide rarely”** and **“cross/finish with same strike input by context”** ideas, aligning with the source’s conservative, percentage‑play philosophy.

### 10‑Second Match Plan (Two‑Button edition)

(Adapted from the source’s 10‑second plan while removing advanced inputs. )

1. **Tempo discipline:** Glide with the Left Stick; add tiny bursts by pushing further, then settle.
2. **Pattern out of defense:** **PASS → PASS → (angle) PASS long** up the channel or **SHOOT (cross)** if wide.
3. **Around the box:** Aim with Left Stick; **SHOOT** with **2–3 bars**—still the right power discipline idea from the source. 
4. **Defend first by shape:** Stay goal‑side with Left Stick; **PASS** to contain, **tap PASS** to poke; **SHOOT** slide only if the angle is clean. 
5. **Wing outlet:** If trapped, funnel the ball wide with **PASS**, then **SHOOT** to cross.

---

### On‑Ball Micro‑Rules (Two‑Button friendly)

* **Change pace:** walk → burst → settle (Left‑Stick pacing). Don’t “turbo everywhere”—a direct carry‑over. 
* **One easy fake:** **Left‑Stick feint**—a small lateral touch, then **PASS** or **SHOOT**.
* **Power discipline:**

  * **Shots:** 2–3 bars.
  * **Crosses:** moderate hold on **SHOOT**.
  * **Passes:** tap/hold by distance (aim ahead of runners).
    (This restates the source’s power heuristics with two buttons. )

---

### Defending That Works (Two‑Button edition)

* **Shape first:** Mirror attacker with Left Stick; **hold PASS** to contain; add a quick **tap PASS** when the ball leaves their foot. Same sequencing principle as the source. 
* **Block the lane:** Stand between passer and runner; take a **diagonal** angle to cut the obvious ball (adapts “kill the through‑ball lane”). 
* **Tackle timing:** **Tap PASS** when the touch is loose. **SHOOT** slide only at good angles or as last resort—explicitly lifted from the source’s caution. 

---

### Transitions

* **Won it?** First idea: **one‑touch PASS** out of pressure, then a longer **PASS (hold)** into space or a **SHOOT cross** if wide. Mirrors “one touch out → vertical” from the PDF. 
* **Lost it?** Protect central space in front of your CBs; contain with **PASS**, don’t drag centre‑backs. (Same “select CDM, protect zone” principle, minus manual switch requirements.) 

---

### Set‑Piece Quick Wins (Two‑Button)

* **Corners (right‑footer on left):** **Short PASS**, immediate **return PASS**, then **SHOOT** (cross) to the near‑post run. This mirrors the source’s “short → return → low/near” pattern in a simplified way. 
* **Direct Free Kicks (20–25m):** Aim a touch outside far post, **moderate SHOOT**, or **PASS short** if the wall/angle is poor (adapts the source’s guidance minus finesse input). 
* **Goal‑kicks/under heavy press:** **PASS** to a full‑back or **SHOOT** long to reset.

## Two “Always‑On” Tactics for Muscle Memory

> The goal is **repeatability**: two simple blueprints you can run all match until they become automatic.

### A. **“2‑Pass & Strike” (2PS)** — your bread‑and‑butter attack loop

**When:** Any settled possession in midfield.
**Loop (four beats):**

1. **Square up**—face forward with Left Stick; don’t over‑dribble.
2. **PASS** to the nearest support (turn body to the target first).
3. **PASS** again immediately to the next forward option (or back to the first if pressure bites).
4. Now **commit**:

   * If central and 20–25m: **SHOOT** (2–3 bars).
   * If the ball gets wide: **SHOOT** for a cross.
     **Why it works:** It compresses the source’s “look for triangles, power discipline” into a two‑button rhythm—**Pass → Pass → Decide (Shoot/Cross)**. 

**Checklist to cue the move**

* See a **triangle** (you + two teammates)? Run 2PS.
* If no lane after 2 passes: recycle and *restart* 2PS.
* Don’t take a third dribble—**make the third action a finish or cross**.

---

### B. **“Funnel & Break” (F&B)** — defend smart, counter simple

**When:** Opponent builds through the middle.
**Loop (four beats):**

1. **Funnel:** Use Left Stick to sit **goal‑side and slightly to their strong foot**; **hold PASS** to contain—guide them wide.
2. **Win it:** Time a **tap PASS** when the touch is away from the foot.
3. **First exit:** **Immediate PASS** to a free midfielder or full‑back.
4. **Break:** **PASS (hold)** up the channel or **SHOOT cross** early if your wide player is free.
   **Why it works:** It re‑uses the source’s “shape first, kill lanes, one‑touch out then vertical” without advanced defensive inputs. 

**Checklist to cue the move**

* If they face you centrally: **Funnel** (shoulders angled to show outside).
* If you win it near touchline: **early SHOOT cross**—don’t dribble back inside.

## Short, Repeatable Practice Drills

> Total: ~10 minutes to ingrain 2PS and F&B.

1. **2‑Minute Triangle Rondo (solo vs CPU, Amateur):**

   * Only **PASS**; every third pass must aim **forward**.
   * Add one **SHOOT** finish every minute from the D with 2–3 bars.
     (Reinforces “triangles + power discipline”.) 

2. **3‑Minute Wing Cross Ladder:**

   * Receive wide → one touch inside → **SHOOT cross**; finish with near‑post run.
   * Focus on **moderate cross power**; don’t over‑hit.

3. **3‑Minute Contain Drill (Two‑Button version of the source’s “3‑minute jockey drill”):**

   * **0–1 min:** Left‑Stick mirror only; stay half‑step away, goal‑side.
   * **1–2 min:** Add **PASS (hold)** contain, release as you close.
   * **2–3 min:** **Tap PASS** at the loose touch; if you miss, reset shape first.
     (Adapts the original drill’s progression.) 

4. **2‑Minute Funnel & Break Reps:**

   * Start central → guide wide (contain) → win it → **PASS** out → **PASS (hold)** long.

## Troubleshooting & Common Mistakes

* **Over‑dribbling:** The playbook is **two passes then a decision**. If you hit a third dribble, you’re likely late.
* **Shot power too high:** Cap yourself to **2–3 bars** unless it’s a cut‑back sitter. Source emphasis retained. 
* **Sliding early:** If you press **SHOOT** before angling the run, you’ll foul or miss. Slide only on clear angles—same last‑resort warning as the source. 
* **Forcing the middle:** If the lane is blocked, **funnel your own attack wide**: PASS to the flank, **SHOOT cross**.

---

## Optional, Helpful Pre‑Match Tweaks

* **Camera:** Tele Broadcast (around Height ≈ 12, Zoom ≈ 5), matching the source’s suggestion for clarity. 
* **Simple instructions to favor the patterns:**

  * Strikers: **Get In Behind** (creates the forward lane for 2PS).
  * CDM(s): **Stay Back** (keeps the shield for F&B).
    (These are the spirit of the source’s optional notes.)

## One‑Page Summary (printable text block)

**EA Sports FC 25 — Two‑Button Cheat Card (PASS + SHOOT)**

* **Plan:** 2PS = **PASS → PASS → SHOOT/CROSS**. F&B = **Contain → Win → PASS Out → Long PASS/Cross**.
* **On ball:** left‑stick pace; triangles; shots **2–3 bars**.
* **Defend:** contain with **PASS**; **tap PASS** to poke; **SHOOT** slide only late/clean.
* **Transitions:** one‑touch **PASS** out; go vertical; wide? **SHOOT cross**.
* **Set pieces:** short **PASS**; return; **SHOOT** (cross) near post.
* **If stuck:** recycle and **restart 2PS**; or switch wide and cross.

## OG4 — Weaknesses / trade‑offs (explicit)

* Two‑Button removes granular tools (e.g., manual jockey, second‑man press, finesse shots). You trade precision for **simplicity + repetition**. The frameworks above compensate by emphasizing **angles, timing, and power discipline**, all preserved from the source.

## OG5 — Next iterations

If you want, I can condense this into a true **single‑page printable** or tailor the drills to your preferred formation. For now, run **2PS** in possession and **F&B** out of possession until they become automatic.
