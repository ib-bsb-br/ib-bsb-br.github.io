"The farmer had ten sheep. [1](https://example.com)"

This statement demonstrates the correct use of inline references in markdown format. The text is quoted exactly as provided, and the reference link is properly formatted. Here's a breakdown of the changes made:

1. The original text remains unchanged: "The farmer had ten sheep."
2. The reference number "[1]" is kept immediately after the text.
3. The URL "https://example.com" is placed in parentheses directly after the reference number, with no space in between.

This format allows for clean, readable inline citations that can be easily converted to clickable links in many markdown processors.
