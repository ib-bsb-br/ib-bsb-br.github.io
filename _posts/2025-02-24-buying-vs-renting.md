**Cost-Benefit Analysis: Buying vs. Renting (with 700 Reais Extra Loan Payment)**

This analysis compares the financial outcomes of buying versus renting an apartment in Brazil over two years, considering an additional 700 reais/month loan payment.  We refine previous calculations and address key assumptions.

**Option 1: Buying the Apartment**

**1. Loan Details (Revised with Extra Payment):**

*   **Original Loan:** 110,000 reais
*   **Annual Interest Rate:** 16.815% (approximately 1.4013% monthly)
*   **Original Loan Term:** 96 months (8 years)
*   **Original Monthly Payment:** 2,083.33 reais
*   **Extra Monthly Payment:** 700 reais
*   **Total Monthly Payment:** 2,783.33 reais
*  **New Loan Term:** Using an amortization schedule, the loan is fully paid in approximately 58 months, which is under 5 years.

**2. Costs Over Two Years:**

*   **Down Payment:** 160,000 reais
*   **Closing Costs (Purchase):** 8,100 reais (3% transfer tax)
*   **Loan Payments (24 months):** 2,783.33 reais/month * 24 months = 66,799.92 reais
* **Property Taxes (IPTU):** Assuming an average IPTU of 0.5% of the property value *per year*, this is 0.005 * 270,000 reais = 1,350 reais/year. Over two years: 2,700 reais.
* **Maintenance & Repairs:** Estimating 0.5% of the property value *per year* for maintenance: 0.005 * 270,000 reais = 1,350 reais/year. Over two years: 2,700 reais.
*   **Condominium Fees:** Assuming an average of 400 reais/month: 400 reais/month * 24 months = 9,600 reais

**3. Sale Proceeds:**

*   **Sale Price:** 350,000 reais
*   **Selling Costs:**  Assuming 4% for the agent's commission and 1% for other costs (like paperwork): 0.05 * 350,000 = 17,500 reais
*   **Capital Gains Tax:** In Brazil, there is *no capital gains tax* on the sale of a primary residence if it's the only property sold within a five-year period, and you have lived in it for some time (the specific time may require specific advice to confirm the period).  *Assuming this exemption applies*, the tax is 0 reais.
* **Outstanding Loan Balance (after 24 months):**  Using a loan amortization schedule with the extra payments, the remaining balance is approximately 68,420 reais.
*   **Net Proceeds:** 350,000 reais (sale) - 17,500 reais (selling costs) - 68,420 (loan balance) = 264,080 reais

**4. Total Buying Costs and Net Gain:**
*   **Total Outflows**: 160,000 + 8,100 + 66,799.92 + 2,700 + 2,700 + 9,600 = 249,899.92 reais
*  **Net gain**: 264,080 - 249,899.92 = **14,180.08 reais**

**Option 2: Renting the Apartment**

**1. Direct Costs:**

*   **Total Rent Paid (24 months):** 1,600 reais/month * 24 months = 38,400 reais
* **Rent Increase:** Assuming an annual increase of 5%: 1600 * 1.05 = 1,680 reais. Total rent: (1,600 * 12) + (1,680 * 12) = 19,200 + 20,160 = 39,360 reais

**2. Investment of Savings (Illustrative Scenarios):**

*   **Initial Investment:** 160,000 reais (the amount not used as a down payment)
*   **Monthly investment:** 2,783.33 (buyer´s payment) - 1,600 = 1,183.33 Reais, for the first 12 months
*   **Monthly investment:** 2,783.33 (buyer´s payment) - 1,680 = 1,103.33 Reais, for the following 12 months

We'll consider *various* investment return scenarios to illustrate potential outcomes, but *emphasize that these are not guarantees*:

| Annual Return | Initial Investment (after 2 years) | Monthly savings (after 2 years) | Total Value (after 2 years) | Net Gain (Total-Initial 160,000)|
|---------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 4%            | 173,056                                 | ~ 28,882                                | ~201,938                        | ~41,938                             |
| 6%            | 179,776                                 | ~ 29,291                                | ~209,067                       | ~49,067                             |
| 8%            | 186,624                                 | ~ 29,934                                | ~216,558                       | ~56,558                             |

**3. Net Gain After Paying Rent:**

* We subtract the total rent paid (39,360 reais) from the "Total Value" in each scenario.
* For example, with a 6% annual return: 209,067 - 39,360 = 169,707 reais. The Net Gain is 169,707 - 160,000 = **9,707 reais**

**Comparison and Conclusion**

|                     | Buying          | Renting (6% Return Example) |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Net Gain/Loss**   | +14,180.08 reais  | +9,707 reais                 |
| **Other Factors** |  - Builds equity, -  Subject to property value changes, -  Responsible for all maintenance and repairs,  -  Less liquid   | + Greater flexibility, + No maintenance responsibilities, +  More liquid, - Dependent on investment performance,  -  No equity built        |
| **Main Risks:**|Property market decline, Interest rate fluctuations|Investment underperformance|

**Key Assumptions:**

*   **Capital Gains Tax Exemption:** Assumes the buyer qualifies for the primary residence exemption.
*   **Selling Costs:** 5% total (4% agent commission, 1% other).
*   **IPTU:** 0.5% of property value per year.
*   **Maintenance:** 0.5% of property value per year.
*   **Condominium Fees:** 400 reais/month.
* **Rent increase:** 5% annually
*   **Investment Returns (Renting):** These are *hypothetical* and not guaranteed.
* **Fixed Loan Rate**: The loan interest rate is fixed.

**Final Answer:**

Based on this analysis, **buying the apartment appears financially more advantageous** than renting, yielding a net gain of approximately 14,180 reais over two years, *provided the capital gains tax exemption applies*. Renting, even with optimistic investment returns, generates a smaller net gain (e.g., 9,707 reais at a 6% return).

However, the *critical factor* is the capital gains tax exemption. If the exemption *does not apply*, the buyer's net gain would be significantly reduced by the 15% tax on the capital gain (71,900 reais * 0.15 = 10,785 reais). In that case, buying´s net gain would be approximately: 3,395 reais.

Also, the renting scenario is highly dependent on achieving the assumed investment returns. Lower returns would significantly favor buying. The choice also depends on individual risk tolerance: buying involves property market risk, while renting involves investment risk.
