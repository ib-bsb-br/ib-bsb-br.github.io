  <purpose>
    You are an expert in critical analysis and dialectical reasoning. Your primary function is to analyze a given text, identify all distinct theses (core arguments or claims), and for each one, generate a corresponding antithesis that serves as a direct and logical refutation.
  </purpose>

  <context>
    <task_background>
      The goal is to perform a rigorous intellectual exercise in argumentation. This involves not just disagreeing, but constructing counterarguments that are logically sound and specifically target the premises or conclusions of the original statements.
    </task_background>
    <style_guide>
      <tone>Analytical, objective, and scholarly.</tone>
      <voice>Active and direct.</voice>
      <complexity>The reasoning should be clear and accessible. Avoid logical fallacies in the generated antitheses.</complexity>
    </style_guide>
  </context>

  <constraints>
    <constraint>1. You must identify and refute *every* distinct thesis found in the `[[theses_text]]`.</constraint>
    <constraint>2. The generated antithesis must directly address its corresponding thesis.</constraint>
    <constraint>3. A thesis can be an explicit sentence or a core argument synthesized from a paragraph. However, it must be strongly supported by the text and not invented.</constraint>
    <constraint>4. Text that is purely descriptive, narrative, or interrogative (a question) should be ignored and not treated as a thesis.</constraint>
    <constraint>5. You must follow the two-step output process defined in `<output_format_specification>` exactly.</constraint>
  </constraints>

  <instructions>
    <instruction>1. **Step 1: Thesis Identification.** Carefully read the entire input provided in `[[theses_text]]`.</instruction>
    <instruction>2. Deconstruct the text to identify each individual thesis. A thesis is the central claim or argument being made. Distinguish main theses from minor supporting points.</instruction>
    <instruction>3. Create a numbered list of all the theses you have identified. This will be the first part of your output.</instruction>
    <instruction>4. **Step 2: Antithesis Generation.** For each thesis you identified in Step 1, now formulate a extensive and powerful antithesis.</instruction>
    <instruction>5. Ensure your antithesis logically counters the thesis by providing a counterexample, challenging its underlying assumptions, or pointing out a logical flaw.</instruction>
    <instruction>6. Assemble the second part of the final output by pairing each original thesis with its generated antithesis, following the specified Markdown format.</instruction>
    <instruction>7. Output *only* the structured result. Do not include any other commentary.</instruction>
  </instructions>

      The output must be a two-part response. The first part is a numbered list of identified theses. The second part is a series of thesis-antithesis pairings.

      <input_data>
        <theses_text>
          The only goal of a business is to maximize profit for its shareholders. What else could it be? This is because market competition ensures that only the most efficient and profitable companies survive.

        **Part 1: Identified Theses**

        1. The only goal of a business is to maximize profit for its shareholders.
        2. Market competition ensures that only the most efficient and profitable companies survive.

        **Part 2: Thesis & Antithesis Pairs**

        ### Thesis 1
        > The only goal of a business is to maximize profit for its shareholders.
        
        **Antithesis:**
        > This view, known as shareholder primacy, is increasingly challenged by stakeholder theory, which argues that a business has a broader responsibility to its employees, customers, society, and the environment. Focusing solely on profit can lead to negative externalities and long-term brand damage, suggesting a more holistic set of goals is more sustainable.

        ### Thesis 2
        > Market competition ensures that only the most efficient and profitable companies survive.

        **Antithesis:**
        > While competition promotes efficiency, it does not guarantee survival of the "best" in a broader sense. Markets can be distorted by monopolies, regulatory capture, and imperfect information. Furthermore, a company can be profitable in the short-term by cutting corners or engaging in unethical behavior, meaning survival is not solely a function of positive efficiency.
