Below is a refactored explanation focusing on how the “autorandr” tool (from the GitHub repository phillipberndt/autorandr) can simplify connecting a Raspberry Pi 4B running openSUSE Tumbleweed to various projectors or ultrawide monitors, without constantly registering specific resolutions or editing xrandr files.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Why autorandr?  
autorandr is a Python-based utility that automatically detects and applies display configurations based on the monitors or projectors you connect. It allows you to:  
• Save a display setup as a “profile” (e.g., “conference_room,” “classroom_projector,” “ultrawide,” etc.).  
• Detect and automatically reapply the saved configuration whenever that monitor or projector is reconnected.  
• Eliminate the need for repeated manual xrandr or config file edits.

2) Installing autorandr on openSUSE Tumbleweed  
• Check if autorandr is available in openSUSE’s package repositories. For many distributions, it is included or can be accessed via the openSUSE Build Service. You could do, for instance:  
  sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in autorandr  
• If a packaged version is unavailable or outdated, clone the GitHub repository (phillipberndt/autorandr) and run:  
  make install  
  (or follow the README for alternative install methods such as pip or rpm.)

3) Creating and Using Profiles  
Below is a common workflow for a professor who frequently connects to different projectors:  

  a) Connect to a new projector or monitor and manually adjust resolution/arrangement just once using your desktop’s display settings or xrandr commands.  
  b) Save that arrangement as a new autorandr profile, for example:  
     autorandr --save classroom1  
  c) The next time you plug into that same projector, autorandr detects it and directly applies your “classroom1” configuration. No extra manual steps needed.  

You can repeat the steps above for an ultrawide monitor, a second projector, an auditorium projector, etc. Each unique setup can be saved under a different profile name.

4) Automatically Switching Configurations  
To let autorandr reconfigure displays automatically whenever the Pi detects a new or removed display device:  
• Enable the provided udev/systemd rules, or:  
• Use the systemd service that runs autorandr upon display changes.  
This ensures you don’t have to issue commands manually each time you attach a projector or unplug a monitor.

5) Catch-All Default Fallback  
If no recognized profile matches the newly connected display, autorandr either keeps the current setup or you can specify a “default” profile:  
  autorandr --default universalFallback  
This might be a simple 1280×720 arrangement that works well on most projectors.

6) Handling Edge Cases or Advanced Needs  
• If a projector’s EDID is partially broken or missing, you can use “autorandr --match-edid” or fallback to generic “safe” modes.  
• You can still add or override modes with xrandr if needed and re-save with autorandr; the next time, it remembers.  
• Optionally, run hook scripts (e.g., “postswitch” in ~/.config/autorandr/) to do tasks such as adjusting wallpaper or launching presentation software whenever a new display profile is loaded.

Summary:  
Instead of configuring dozens of resolutions or modelines for all possible projectors, autorandr provides a straightforward “plug it in once, save the profile, auto-detect next time” workflow. This is especially useful for busy educators using the Raspberry Pi 4B on openSUSE Tumbleweed. By collecting each new setup with “autorandr --save”, you can seamlessly connect to 80%+ of commonly encountered projectors or monitors without further xrandr tinkering.
