────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION A: QUICK-START SUMMARY FOR BEGINNERS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Download Essentials  
   – Raspberry Pi Imager or Balena Etcher.  
   – LineageOS 22 build (Android 15) from the KonstaKANG site for your Pi model.  
   – GApps package (e.g., NikGapps “Core”).  

2. Flash the Image  
   – Launch Raspberry Pi Imager → “Use custom” → select the unzipped .img.  
   – Insert SD card (≥ 32 GB), confirm the correct storage is selected, and write.

3. First Boot & Setup  
   – Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi.  
   – Complete the initial welcome wizard (language, time, Wi-Fi).  
   – If your display is blank/rainbow, see advanced steps below on resolution.txt or config.txt adjustments.

4. Install Google Apps  
   – Reboot into TWRP recovery: enable “Advanced Restart” in Settings → Developer options, then choose “Recovery.”  
   – In TWRP: “Mount” → select USB or SD where GApps .zip is located → “Install” → choose the .zip → Swipe to flash.  
   – Reboot to system, sign in to Play Store.

5. Keep System Updated  
   – Check if new OTA packages are available from KonstaKANG.  
   – Reflash GApps or Magisk after each OTA, if necessary.

SECTION B: DETAILED GUIDE & ADVANCED TOPICS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. PRE-INSTALLATION PREPARATION  
   – Hardware Requirements: Pi 4 or Pi 5 recommended, 2 GB+ RAM. A good SD card or USB drive for faster performance.  
   – Verify your internet connection (Ethernet or Wi-Fi) ahead of time if possible.  

2. FLASHING & CONFIGURE BOOT (USB/NVMe)  
   – If booting from USB or NVMe, open /boot/config.txt after flashing and uncomment the relevant line (#dtoverlay=android-usb).  
   – Keep the other overlays commented out to avoid conflicts (#dtoverlay=android-sdcard, #dtoverlay=android-nvme) unless you specifically want them.

3. FIRST BOOT ADJUSTMENTS  
   – Explore “Settings → System → Raspberry Pi settings” for toggles: enabling DSI display over HDMI, IR remote, SSH server, RTC modules, etc.  
   – Confirm date/time are correct before installing any apps (Google sign-in issues can arise if the time is off).

4. GAPS (GOOGLE APPS) & OTHER FLASHABLES (MAGISK)  
   – Use TWRP to install GApps by mounting the storage with the .zip, then installing.  
   – If you want root, install Magisk .zip in the same TWRP session.  
   – Reboot and ensure Google Play is visible among installed apps.

5. TROUBLESHOOTING & MAINTENANCE  
   – Display Issues: Edit /boot/resolution.txt or remove it to rely on EDID.  
   – Audio Output: Switch between HDMI / 3.5 mm in Raspberry Pi settings.  
   – OTA Updates: Download the new .zip, flash in TWRP again. This preserves /boot folder custom settings and device-specific changes.  
   – Reinstall or flash GApps or Magisk after an update if you lose them.

6. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS & CAUTIONS  
   – Non-Commercial License: The build includes parts under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0; check the developer’s site for commercial usage details.  
   – For Pi 3 or older boards, confirm hardware support since advanced features require Pi 4 or later.  
   – Consider official Raspberry Pi docs for deeper config.txt editing, overlays, or advanced hardware expansions.
