<p>Notes:</p>

<p>• PCs made after 1997 that run Windows 98 or higher, and Mac-intosh computers such as the iMac, are likely to have USB ports built in. USB ports can also be added to older computers.</p>

<p>• The computer does not have to be turned off to connect USB devices.</p>

<p>• The same USB cable is used to connect both PCs and Macin-tosh computers.</p>

<p>• Standard A-B USB cables found in computer stores may be used.</p>

<p>• PCs must be running Windows 98 or newer to use the USB port, as Windows 95 and older do not support USB.</p>

<p>• Windows NT does not support USB</p>

</blockquote>

<p>AlphaSmart 3000 9</p>

<p>To install the Mac Y cable between your AlphaSmart 3000 and a Macintosh: 1. Unplug the mouse from your keyboard. 2. Insert the green end of the Mac Y cable into the empty ADB port on your keyboard where you just unplugged your mouse. 3. Plug your mouse into the red end of the Mac Y cable. 4. The grey end should be plugged into the computer port on the right side of your AlphaSmart 3000.</p>

<p>Note: The Mac Y cable may also be used to connect a Macintosh to an AlphaSmart 2000 or AlphaSmart Pro. To do so, connect the blue end of the Mac Y cable (instead of the grey end) into the computer port on the right side of your AlphaSmart.</p>

<p>Concerns about ADB Live Connect/Disconnect</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 is designed to be connected to and disconnected from Macintosh ADB ports while the Mac is still running. Some people may be concerned about this, since Apple recommends not unplugging or attaching an ADB device while the computer is running. This is recommended by Apple because certain ADB devices change modes when they are unplugged, causing confusion to the system when the devices are reattached. However, the AlphaSmart 3000 has been designed to not change modes when unplugged. More importantly, it does not confuse the Mac when unplugged and reconnected.</p>

<p>12 Hardware Installation and Maintenance Batteries and Power Requirements</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 runs on three AA batteries of the same type (alkaline, carbon, or rechargeable). The longest battery life will be achieved with alkaline batteries. Good quality AA alkaline batteries will power the AlphaSmart 3000 for 700+ hours. (When the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned off, no power from the batteries is used.) One of the ways the AlphaSmart 3000 obtains such good battery life is by entering a low power sleep mode that uses much less power when nothing is being typed. When something is typed, the AlphaSmart 3000 wakes up, displays and saves the character, and then goes back to sleep—all transparent to the user. If a user is a slow typist or pauses while composing text, that user will get much longer battery life than a user who types 120 WPM all the time. A very slow typist can get over 700 hours of use. The fastest typist with constant use will see 350 hours or more of use. A “typical” user typing at 20 wpm constantly with no breaks will get about 700 hours of use. (The battery life hours mentioned above were measured using high quality alkaline batteries, such as Duracell or Panasonic.)</p>

<p>Warning: If several AlphaSmart 3000s are stacked on top of each other and if the one on top is offset by 1 inch to the front and 1/2 inch to the right, the rubber foot of the one on top may depress the on/off key of the AlphaSmart 3000 on the bottom. Constant depression of the on/off key by the rubber foot of the unit on top will cause a small but constant battery power drain, even though nothing is displayed on the screen. Solution: Stack your AlphaSmart 3000s on edge or make sure they are stacked verti-cally and not offset. Note: When replacing batteries, all three batteries must be changed. If one discharged AA battery is used with two new batteries, the user will see a marked reduction in the battery life—4-5 hours will be common— even though two out of the three are new batteries. AlphaSmart 3000 13 Rechargeable Battery Pack</p>

<p>For convenience, you may purchase an AlphaSmart 3000 rechargeable battery pack (please visit www.alphasmart.com for details). When the rechargeable battery pack is installed into your AlphaSmart 3000, it is automatically recharged whenever the AC adapter is plugged in, or when your AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer via a USB cable. The battery pack is charged regardless of whether the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned on or off.</p>

<p>Note: If you order a rechargeable battery pack when ordering your AlphaSmart 3000, the pack will be factory installed. If you order the pack later, you will have to install it.</p>

     <a href="#installing-a-rechargeable-battery-pack">#</a><a href="#" aria-label="Back to top">Installing a Rechargeable Battery Pack</a>
        
    
  </h1>
      

<p>To install the rechargeable battery pack, follow the directions below. You will need one small Phillips screwdriver. 1. Remove the eight Phillips screws on the back of the AlphaSmart 3000 case. 2. Turn the unit right side up and lift off the front of the case. 3. Remove the AA batteries, if they are installed. 4. Place the rechargeable pack in the battery compartment with the wires to the left side of the compartment. 5. Insert the white battery pack connector into connector J5 on the printed circuit board, just below and to the left of the tab key. The little bump on the connector will be up. The connector only goes in one way, so you can’t install it wrong. 14 Hardware Installation and Maintenance</p>

<ol>
  <li>Replace the top case, turn over, and replace the eight screws.</li>

  </h1>
      

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 rechargeable battery pack uses NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride) cells. NiMH has no memory effect and can be charged 500–1000 times. A fully charged battery pack will power the AlphaSmart 3000 for 60–150 hours, depending on use. You will get the longest life from your battery pack if you wait for the Low Battery message to appear on the AlphaSmart 3000 screen so the pack is not needlessly recharged. The battery pack is recharged whenever the AC adapter is plugged into the AlphaSmart 3000. In addition, the AlphaSmart 3000 also recharges whenever it is connected to a computer through its USB cable (charging while the computer is on). The battery pack will charge whether the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned on or off. An overnight charge of 16 hours will give a good charge to a pack, but an over-the-weekend charge of 60 hours will fully charge a discharged pack. However, the battery pack should not be recharged for longer than a week.</p>

<p>AlphaSmart 3000 15 Storing a Rechargeable Battery Pack</p>

<p>Rechargeable batteries which are not used over time lose their charge and should be recharged before use. Always fully charge your battery before you use it after it has been stored for more than a month.</p>

<p>Lifetime of the Rechargeable Battery Pack</p>

<p>Don’t expect rechargeable batteries to last forever. Well-maintained rechargeable batteries last about 500 charges or about three years. If your battery used to last 40 hours but now only lasts one hour, it’s time for a new battery.</p>

<p>Note: If your batteries are dead and you have no AC adapter, you can still send your data to a Macintosh or PC. Simply attach the AlphaSmart 3000 to the Macintosh or PC and turn it on. The cable will supply power to the AlphaSmart 3000 while attached. You can’t do any editing, but you can transfer the data in your files.</p>

<p>Toxic Elements Statement</p>

<p>Each battery cell is a sealed container enclosing a nickel electrode and a potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The electrolyte is caustic. Avoid contact with skin or eyes. If exposed accidentally, flush eyes with water immediately. Warning: Do not incinerate or mutilate the battery, as this may cause it to burst or release toxic materials. Do not short circuit, as this may cause burns. Please dispose in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.</p>

<p>Use of Other Rechargeable Batteries</p>

<p>Rechargeable alkaline AA batteries and other rechargeable batteries may be used with the AlphaSmart 3000. However, these batteries must be recharged outside the AlphaSmart 3000. Plugging in the AlphaSmart 3000 to an AC adapter will not recharge your removable AA batteries—only the AlphaSmart 3000 rechargeable pack is recharged by the AC adapter.</p>

<p>Low Battery Indication</p>

<p>When your AA batteries or rechargeable battery pack is getting low, a message will flash on your screen: 16 Hardware Installation and Maintenance</p>

<p>Low Battery!!</p>

<p>The Low Battery message will appear about eight hours before your AA batteries are dead and about 20 minutes before your rechargeable batteries are dead.</p>

<p>Battery Status Indicator</p>

<p>A display of the current battery charge level is available within AlphaWord when you use the keyboard command ctrl-x-B. This display shows a graphical representation of the battery charge level. In addition, the graphical representation of the battery charge level is shown in the startup screen when the AlphaSmart 3000 is powered on, and in the screen that you see when you change files in AlphaWord.</p>

<p>Note: Available only with AlphaSmart 3000 v 1.4 or higher</p>

<p>Lithium Battery</p>

<p>AlphaSmart 3000 also uses a secondary backup battery that is not user-accessible. This 3V lithium coin cell battery (CR2032) powers the memory, preventing data loss when the unit is turned off and the primary AA batteries or rechargeable battery pack are dead. This lithium battery should be good for approximately 7–10 years. It is mounted in a socket and is replaceable. To determine if the 3V lithium battery has been discharged: 1. Enter some text into the AlphaSmart 3000. 2. Turn the unit off. 3. Remove the AA batteries and make sure the unit is not plugged into the AC adapter or attached to a Macintosh. 4. Wait two minutes. 5. Replace the AA batteries or plug the AlphaSmart 3000 into an AC adapter. 6. Turn the unit back on. If the text you entered is still there, then the lithium battery is still good. If the text has disappeared and AlphaSmart 3000 17</p>

<p>the file is empty, then the lithium battery has been discharged and should be replaced.</p>

<p>Warning: This procedure may result in data loss. Transfer important files from the AlphaSmart 3000 before proceeding.</p>

<p>To replace the lithium battery, you must take the case apart. See the “Troubleshooting” chapter for instructions. Please dispose of the dis-charged lithium battery properly.</p>

<p>Tips on Caring For Batteries</p>

<p>• To avoid battery leakage, change the batteries as soon as they become weak.</p>

<p>• Do not drop, puncture, disassemble, mutilate or incinerate the bat-teries.</p>

<p>• Recharge only batteries that are rechargeable, and then only as directed in the manual.</p>

<p>• Do not leave batteries in hot locations.</p>

<p>• When storing the AlphaSmart 3000 for several months (like over the summer), remove the batteries.</p>

<p>When you first turn on your AlphaSmart 3000, you will see the start-up screen for a few seconds, which gives your AlphaSmart 3000 version number (for example, AlphaWord v1.x.x, English) and the number of the file it is opening. Then the screen will display the contents of your file. The cursor will be in the same position it was when the AlphaSmart 3000 was last used. To enter text, simply begin typing as you would on any other keyboard. Use the backspace key to erase. As soon as you type each character it is automat-ically saved. There is no Save command. The arrow keys allow you to move your cursor through the text. Additionally, the following keyboard combi-nations will also move your cursor as specified:</p>

<p>x-o moves the cursor up four lines (one displayed page)</p>

<p>x-, moves the cursor down four lines (one displayed page) 20 Using Your AlphaSmart 3000</p>

<p>x-k moves the cursor to the beginning of the line</p>

<p>x-l moves the cursor to the end of the line</p>

<p>Home moves the cursor to the beginning of the document</p>

<p>End moves the cursor to the end of the document As with any word processing application, the text will automatically wrap at the end of each line, so you should use the enter key only to separate paragraphs.</p>

  </h1>
      

<p>All text formatting, including margins, tab stops, font, size, and other styling attributes, are done on the desktop computer after the file has been transferred from the AlphaSmart 3000. Only the characters themselves (ASCII key codes) are transferred from the AlphaSmart 3000 to the computer. However, the tab key can be used on the AlphaSmart 3000 to create columns or paragraph indentations which will transfer to the Macintosh and PC with the file. When the tab key is used, it will appear as a right arrow on the AlphaSmart 3000 screen when Show Marks is activated. See the Advanced AlphaSmart 3000 Features – Show Marks section for further information. Although text will not appear indented on your AlphaSmart 3000, it will show up indented on your computer. The AlphaSmart 3000 has cut, copy, and paste functions included. See the following section “Editing Text” for more information.</p>

<p>Note: These editing features can also be performed once a file has been transferred to the desktop computer, and may be easier to perform using a larger screen and mouse.</p>

<p>Caps Lock Indicator</p>

<p>When Caps Lock is active, the lower right character of the screen will be solid black. Pressing the Caps Lock key toggles the caps lock on and off. AlphaSmart 3000 21 Editing Text</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 has cut, copy, and paste functions for convenience in editing text. To use these features, begin by moving the cursor under the first letter of the first word in the text you want to select. When you hold down the shift key along with any of the arrow keys, you will notice a flashing block cursor appear over the letter. Use the arrow keys to select the text that you wish to cut, copy or delete. Pressing ctrl-A or x-A will select the entire contents of the file. Once you have selected the text, the following functions can be used:</p>

<p>• Cut/Delete: In order to delete the selected text, use the Cut com-mand ( ctrl-X or x-X ) to move the text to the clipboard, or the backspace key to delete the text entirely.</p>

<p>• Copy: To copy the selected text to the clipboard without deleting it, use the Copy command ( ctrl-C or x-C ).</p>

<p>• Paste: After selected text has been cut or copied, reposition your cursor and use the Paste command ( ctrl-V or x-V ) to place the clip-board contents at the new cursor location. Once you have copied or cut the text, it will reside on the clipboard until the next cut or copy action takes place. The current contents of the clipboard can be viewed at any time using the command ctrl-option-x-C . The contents can be inserted to a new location in the current file, or to a completely different file. The first three lines are the contents of the clipboard, and the last is a prompt. The arrow keys can be used to maneuver your cursor within the clipboard. The standard clipboard size is 25 KB (the same size of each file on the AlphaSmart 3000), and changes when other SmartApplets are installed, so 22 Using Your AlphaSmart 3000</p>

<p>entire files can be selected and copied to the clipboard if necessary. To select all the data within a file, press x-A .You can view the clipboard status by pressing option-x-C .

<p>To access the AlphaSmart Find feature, press the find key or x-F. You will see a screen that says:</p>

<p>Find:<strong>__</strong>___ Press Enter to search in file 1, Option-Enter to search in all files, CMD-G to Find again, Esc to exit.</p>

<p>At the cursor, you may enter up to 16 characters. The search is not case sensitive, so if you are looking for “CAT” and type in “cat”, the search will find cat, CAT, Cat, or caT. It will also find partial words or characters embedded in other words. For example, if you searched for “cat”, it will also show you “catalog.” If you press enter after entering your search text, it will search in the current file only. If you press Option-Enter , it will search in all eight files. However, if password protection is activated, the Option-Enter command cannot be used and you can only search in the current file. When a string is found in a different file than the one currently displayed, it will open that file and put a cursor at the end of the string it found. After the text is found once, you may continue the search by pressing</p>

<p>x-G . The next occurrence will be displayed or the message Text NOT found will be displayed. ( x-G does not bring up the Find dialog screen, unless this is the first time you are using the Find function.) AlphaSmart 3000 23 Working with Files</p>

<p>The first time that the AlphaSmart 3000 is turned on, it will display the message Opening file 1. On subsequent startups, it will automatically open the last file used.</p>

<p>File Capacity</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 supports eight files, which are each 12.5 pages in length, or about 25 KB. This provides a total storage capacity of 100 pages of single-spaced text or 200,000 characters. This file structure is intended to support multiple users or to enable a single user to organize his or her work into chapters or sections. To move between files, press the file 1 key to go to File 1, the file 2 key to go to File 2 and so forth, up to File 8. When an AlphaSmart 3000 file is full, a message will be displayed which reads:</p>

<p>File is full. Use another file or send data to your computer.</p>

<p>File Status</p>

<p>The file status dialog box can be accessed by pressing x-I while in a file. The box displays the current number of pages in a file, and how much space is left.</p>

<p>Erasing Files</p>

<p>Text entered into each file will remain there until you explicitly erase it by pressing the clear file key while the AlphaSmart 3000 is not attached to a desktop computer. This will produce a prompt, asking if you are sure. Press Y for yes, and N for no. Note that when you press the clear file key, you are clearing only the file in which you are currently working; other files will remain unchanged. Once the clear file key is pressed and the file is deleted, information may still be recovered using the Data Recovery command described below. However, for confidential files which you wish to erase without the ability to recover, 24 Using Your AlphaSmart 3000</p>

<p>you may press option-x-clear file . This command permanently erases the contents of the entire file. Use this command with care.</p>

<p>Clear All Files Command</p>

<p>Press option-x-ctrl-shift-clear file to erase all eight files simulta-neously. You will be asked if you are sure—pressing the Y key at this point will clear files 1 through 8. However, this deletion is not permanent, and you can still recover any of the files using the Data Recovery command described below as long as you have not typed new text into the files.</p>

<p>If you accidentally clear a file, it can still be recovered as long as no text has been entered into that file yet. Open the file you wish to recover by pressing one of the file 1–file 8 keys. Press option-x-R to activate the AlphaSmart Data Recovery command. The Data Recovery command restores the end-of-file marker to the same position it was when the file was last cleared (by pressing the clear</p>

<p>file key). So if you accidentally clear a file, option-x-R will restore it. If, however, the Data Recovery command fails to recover the data, try pressing ctrl-option-x-R . This is the Recover 40 Characters command. Each time you press this command it will move the end-of-file marker back 40 characters. Press this command repeatedly until you see all of your text, plus some “garbage.” Then hold the backspace key down until the garbage characters are deleted. You may also try pressing shift-ctrl-option-x-R to recover the entire file. Scroll down to the end of your text where the garbage characters start and press x-backspace to erase from the cursor to the end of the file.</p>

<p>Note: If the file was deleted using the option-x-clear file command, the data is not recoverable. AlphaSmart 3000 25 Spell Check</p>

You must have an application that accepts text (such as a word processing or multimedia application) already open on the computer, and have the cursor placed in the file where you wish to insert the text before pressing the send key. Be sure to be within the application and not the Finder or Desktop when you press the send key, or you may rename your files to the text in your AlphaSmart 3000. When connected and sending files to the computer, the AlphaSmart 3000 screen will display a progress bar, and the show the percent of the file that has been sent. 2. When the transfer is complete, disconnect the AlphaSmart 3000. (You may also leave the AlphaSmart 3000 connected to the computer for use as a normal keyboard.)

<p>Connecting to PC-compatible Laptops</p>

<p>To get an AlphaSmart 3000 to upload to a PC-compatible laptop computer, you must connect the AlphaSmart 3000 the exact same way you would attach an external keyboard to your laptop. Unfortunately, each different PC compatible laptop computer seems to have its own different, often non-obvious, way to connect to an external keyboard. For example, some IBM Thinkpad laptops have a Mini-DIN 6 port with a mouse and keyboard icon near it. One might logically think that one could plug in a mouse or Mini-DIN 6 (PS/2 style) keyboard and expect it to work. Even though it fits, it won’t work. To overcome this problem, you need a special adapter cable that plugs in the port. You may find the adapter at a computer store. AlphaSmart, Inc. does not sell this adapter. 30 Transferring Text to a Computer</p>

<p>Another example is a particular Hitachi laptop model that has a tiny switch that must be turned on in order to get an external keyboard to work. Some laptops (reported with some Compaq models), when attached to the PC, require pressing the enter key on the AlphaSmart 3000 before pressing the send key. (Tech note: Pressing the enter key causes the laptop to switch from listening to the internal keyboard to listening to an external one, e.g. the AlphaSmart 3000.) Since there are so many different types of laptops and differing ways that they each handle external keyboards, you must look in your laptop’s user manual for instructions on connecting an external keyboard. It is best if you can test it with an external PC keyboard first before trying it with an AlphaSmart 3000. If an external keyboard can type into your laptop, then the AlphaSmart 3000 should also be able to connect, type, and send information to your laptop.</p>

<p>With infrared, you can transfer the contents of your AlphaSmart 3000 to a computer or printer without using cables. If your AlphaSmart 3000 has a built-in infrared module, you can send text via infrared to a Mac, PC, or printer. Since the AlphaSmart uses the 100 percent error-free industry standard for infrared (IrDA), it will transfer text to any computer or printer with a built-in IrDA transceiver. You must have AlphaBeam software or Get Utility 3.0 or newer installed on your computer to enable the transfer (see the following sections for more information). It’s easy to use infrared to transfer files. Point the AlphaSmart 3000 towards the computer’s infrared transceiver and press the send key. Text will be transferred to the document or file that is open on the computer. To print, hit the print key on the AlphaSmart 3000 while pointing it towards the printer’s infrared transceiver or module. The AlphaSmart 3000 can be up to three feet (one meter) away while transferring text to and from a computer or printer. AlphaSmart 3000 31</p>

<p>Some of the Macintosh computers equipped with a built-in IrDA transceiver include iMacs (Rev A), the Powerbook 3400C, and the Powerbook G3.</p>

<p>Note: If the computer does not have a built-in IrDA transceiver, you will need to purchase an IrDA infrared serial adapter for Mac or PC from AlphaSmart, Inc. in order to transfer text using infrared. To print with infrared to a printer that does not have built-in infrared, you will need to purchase an IrDA printer adapter from the printer manufacturer, or from one of the companies listed on our website at www.alphasmart.com</p>

<p>Note: Additional installation steps are required if Windows 98 and infrared are being used.</p>

Wherever you would normally type in the information, you can easily download information from an AlphaSmart 3000 by placing your cursor at that point in the new appli-cation and pressing send .</p>

<p>Spreadsheets</p>

<p>You can transfer text directly into a spreadsheet if you are using TurboTransfer Software or Infrared Transfer. However, for some spreadsheet applications, transferring the text directly via a cable will not produce the desired results, as shown in the following example: 1. Open a spreadsheet application and create a new spreadsheet. 2. Put the cursor into the upper left cell of the spreadsheet file. 3. Press send on your AlphaSmart 3000. AlphaSmart 3000 33</p>

<p>Your spreadsheet should look like this: Using the return or enter key at the end of each line causes most spreadsheets to drop straight down a row, instead of going back to the leftmost column of the spreadsheet. To avoid this: 1. Transfer your text to a word processor application. 2. Select the text and copy it. 3. Paste it into your spreadsheet. The paste command will fix the problem and your spreadsheet will look like this:</p>

<p>Note: If you are using TurboTransfer or Infrared Transfer, there is no need to use the procedure shown above. Both transfer methods will paste your text into the spreadsheet correctly.</p>

<p>Databases</p>

<p>The steps below work for transferring text to an AppleWorks (formerly ClarisWorks) database document on a Macintosh. Database programs differ</p>

<p>A B C D E1 98 46 78 2 75 89 100 A B C1 98 46 78 2 75 89 100 34 Transferring Text to a Computer</p>

<p>substantially, so transferring to other databases may require experimen-tation. 1. Create your database in AppleWorks if you haven’t already done so, and set up your fields. 2. Create a tab-delimited record on the AlphaSmart 3000 by entering the data in the tab order of the database, and then pressing the enter key at the end of each record. The tabs separate the fields and the return indicates the end of the previous record and the beginning of the next one. Enter as many records as you want in a single AlphaSmart 3000 file— you do not need to save each record into a separate file. 3. Open the database in AppleWorks on the Macintosh. 4. Open a new empty word processing file. 5. Connect the AlphaSmart to the Mac keyboard cable. 6. Download the data file from the AlphaSmart 3000 to the empty AppleWorks word processing document by pressing the send</p>

<p>key on the AlphaSmart 3000. 7. Select all the downloaded text by choosing Select All from the Mac Edit menu. ( x-A ). 8. Copy the data to the clipboard by choosing Copy from the Edit menu ( x-C or ctrl-C ). 9. Make the database the active AppleWorks document, either by choosing the database file in the View menu or by clicking once in the database window (Do not click on an individual field in the document to make it the active field or all the data will be put into the one field). 10.Paste the data from the clipboard by selecting Paste from the Edit menu or by pressing x-V or ctrl-V . The data will be transferred to the database, beginning with the second record if there was already a record in the database (a newly-created database will have an empty record as the first record). AlphaSmart 3000 35</p>

<p>11.Delete the empty record if needed. Save and close the database. Reopen to verify that the data is there and transmitted correctly. Discard the data in the unnamed text file. Subsequent transmissions of new data will be appended to the end of the database and will not create a new blank record. If the database contains calculated fields, you may simply skip the field by entering a tab. When the data is pasted it will make the calculations automatically in the database. If you find errors in the way the data appears in the database after it has been transferred, you can make the corrections in the original AlphaSmart file and then retransmit the data to the word processing file.</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart can send text faster than some older computers can accept it. If you notice missing characters or jumbled text, then you need to slow down the transfer speed. Even on newer, faster computers, some programs like Microsoft Word, KidWorks™, and Student Writing Center are slow to accept text and you must slow down the AlphaSmart to transfer text into these programs. The AlphaSmart file transfer speed menu is accessed by the keyboard command option-x-S . This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart is attached to a computer. The speed command affects both Mac sending speed and PC sending speed. The AlphaSmart has four file transfer speeds: 1. Very Slow is the slowest speed setting and is compatible with all machines and applications. It is recommended especially when you use graphics intensive programs such as KidWorks or Student Writing Center. If you still lose data sending to KidWorks 2, turn Sound Effects off by deselecting it under the KidWorks 2 Options menu. 36 Transferring Text to a Computer</p>

<ol>
  <li>Slow is compatible with all machines and most applications. It is recommended especially if you are using a Mac Classic, an Apple IIGS or a PC AT (286). 3. Faster (the default speed), and is recommended for the Mac LC or for 386- and 486-based PCs. 4. Fastest provides the quickest transfers. However, some word processing programs may experience a loss of data when files are transferred using this mode, so you may wish to experiment to see which speed works best for you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: The keyboard control panel in your Macintosh system may also need to be adjusted to a faster setting.</p>

<p>If you are using a Mac, you can significantly speed up the transfer of data (approximately six times faster) by using TurboTransfer software (see the section “TurboTransfer Software” later in this manual).</p>

  <li>The first time you use a printer, press option-print to access the printer setup menu. Use the arrow keys to select the appropriate printer from the list given. Your chosen printer will be indicated by a plus sign (+) in front of the printer name. Press enter to leave the menu. 2. Connect the serial cable or AlphaSmart 3000 parallel cable from the AlphaSmart 3000 serial port (on the left-hand side, marked “printer”) to the printer serial or parallel port. The parallel cable is specially made and is not available from computer stores—it has 42 Printing from the AlphaSmart 3000</li>
</ol>

<p>some electronic components built directly into the cable. The serial printer cable is a standard Apple printer cable available at any computer store. 3. Make sure the printer is turned on and, for the ImageWriter II, make sure the Select LED is green (printer is selected to print). 4. Press x-P or the print key on the AlphaSmart 3000 to print the current file. The printer should start to print. The AlphaSmart 3000 will remember your selected printer, so you only have to do Step 1 once, or whenever you change printers.</p>

<p>Note: Font, print quality, line spacing, and margins are based on printer defaults (not AlphaSmart), are fixed, and are not changeable by the user. The line spacing is set for double spacing for easy manual editing.</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 supports printing to older direct-connect printers. If your printer is already connected to a computer or a network, most users find it easier and faster to leave the printer connected to the computer or network, and download the text to the computer for printing.</p>

<p>Printers with DIP switch settings</p>

<p>If the AlphaSmart 3000 fails to print and your printer has DIP switches for different option settings, consult your printer user manual and set the DIP switches to the following settings:</p>

<p>With Key Repeat Control enabled, only one character prints per keystroke. For example, if you hold down the letter “a” key for an extended period of time, you would expect to see the letter continually repeat itself on your screen (“aaaaaaa”). However, with the Key Repeat Control enabled, you would obtain just one “a”, regardless of how long the key was held. The AutoRepeat function can be disabled or enabled by pressing option-x-K to get to the AutoRepeat/Key Repeat Control screen, and then pressing 1. This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer. 46 Advanced AlphaSmart 3000 Features Sticky Keys</p>

<p>With Sticky Keys enabled, you can type combination keystrokes without actually pressing the keys simultaneously. For example, you could press option-x-S individually in order (instead of simultaneously as a group) to get to the AlphaSmart Transfer Speed menu. Sticky Keys affects the four modifier keys: shift, option, command ( x), and control. When Sticky Keys is enabled, pressing a modifier key effec-tively keeps that key “pressed down” for the next normal key press. To enable the Sticky Keys function, press option-x-K and then 2 to either enable or disable Sticky Keys. This command works in stand-alone mode only, not when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to a computer. The current state of the shift, option, command, control, and caps lock keys are shown in the lower right of the AlphaSmart 3000 screen. The last five characters in the lower right corner of the display show which keys are down and which keys are up.</p>

<p>• The right-most character is the caps lock indicator, and is solid black if the caps lock key has been pressed. Caps lock is not affected by the Sticky Keys settings.</p>

<p>• The second character from the bottom right corner is the com-mand ( x) key indicator. If the command key is down, a C will be displayed here.</p>

<p>• The third character from the bottom right corner of the screen is the option key indicator. If the option key is down, an O will be displayed.</p>

<p>• The fourth character from the lower right corner of the screen is the control key indicator. If the control key is down, a C will be displayed here.</p>

<p>• The fifth character from the lower right corner of the screen is the shift key indicator. If the shift key is down, an S will be dis-played here. AlphaSmart 3000 47 Slow Keys</p>

<p>Slow Keys is designed to allow a user with unsteady hands or difficulty in targeting specific keys to set a delay time between depressing a key and the generation of the associated character. The Slow Keys control screen can be displayed with the keyboard command ctrl-option-x-K .To turn Slow Keys on, use the up-arrow or right-arrow key to select a delay value greater than zero (a zero value turns Slow Keys off). Use the down-arrow or left-arrow to decrease the delay value. Once the desired delay value is displayed, press enter to set that value, or esc to cancel any changes you have made. The AutoRepeat delay, which is normally about one second, will be increased to match the Slow Keys delay if it is greater than one second. For example, a Slow Keys delay setting of 1.5 seconds will set the AutoRepeat delay to about 1.5 seconds as well. This means that, after pressing and holding a key down, there would be a 1.5-second delay before a character appeared, and after an additional 1.5 seconds, that character would begin to AutoRepeat. The Slow Keys delay does not apply to key use in the Slow Keys control screen.</p>

If eight different students are to share an AlphaSmart 3000, instruct each student to set their own private password for their own file. Tell them to use “write” as the old password.</p>

<p>Changing a Password</p>

<ol>
  <li>Turn the AlphaSmart 3000 on and make sure it is not connected to a computer. Open file x (you might need to enter the password if password protection is on). 2. Press option-x-P to show the Change Password dialog box. If pressed in file 4, you will see:</li>
</ol>

<p>Change password for file 4Old password: <strong>___ New password: __</strong>_ Press esc key to exit.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First type the old password, which is “write” if this is the first time. (If you have forgotten the old password, the master password may be entered by the teacher). As you type the old password, Xs will appear for each character. If you type the password incorrectly, the message Invalid password, please try again will appear, and you can try again. When you correctly type the old password, your screen will say:</li>
</ol>

<p>Change password for file 4Old password: XXXXX AlphaSmart 3000 55</p>

<p>New password: <strong>__</strong>_ Press esc key to exit.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The cursor will be in the third row, waiting for you to type in the new password. Any letters or numbers can be used for the password. Unlike the old password, each character of the new password will be displayed as it is typed. If you don’t want anyone to see your password, be sure to type your password in a private location.</li>
</ol>

<p>Change password for file 4Old password: XXXXX New password: abcde Press esc key to exit.</p>

<p>As soon as you type the 6th letter of the new password, you will be prompted to reenter the master password a 2nd time. Once you’ve entered it the 2nd time, hit the Enter key and you will see message “Your password has been changed” appear for a second, and then you will return to the original file opened. (Passwords are all lowercase; shift or caps lock has no effect.) Please note that the Master Password can be changed. For detailed instructions, please call AlphaSmart directly. When password protection is enabled, anytime you change files you will be asked for that file’s password before being allowed to edit that file. All individual file passwords can be overridden by typing the master password. If, when turning on the AlphaSmart 3000, you are prompted for the password for a file that isn’t yours, simply press the appropriate file number to get your own file and enter your password.</p>

<p>Password Reset</p>

<p>AlphaWord file passwords can all be reset to the factory default value using the keyboard command ctrl-shift-option-x-P and entering the master password. AlphaWord file passwords can be any length from 1 to 6 characters. Backspace and Tab characters cannot be used in passwords, and the 56 Advanced AlphaSmart 3000 Features</p>

<p>Get Utility is a software utility application for PC or Mac that allows the user to send text from a computer to an AlphaSmart 3000, an AlphaSmart 2000, or an AlphaSmart Pro version 2.09, or version 2.1.3 or newer (not to version 2.1 or 2.1.2). You can send text to an AlphaSmart from your computer by using either a USB, a Mac or PC Y cable, or by infrared transfer (if your AlphaSmart 3000 is equipped with an infrared module). The program transfers the current contents of the Windows Clipboard to an attached AlphaSmart 3000. (The Clipboard is a memory buffer that allows the transfer of information between different programs.) 58 Software for the AlphaSmart 3000 Turbo Transfer Software For Macintosh</p>

<p>TurboTransfer Software provides a simple way to speed up the data transfer rate between your AlphaSmart 3000 and your Macintosh. Typically, you should notice your transfer speed increase by six times when using TurboTransfer Software.</p>

<p>Following is a list of difficulties you may encounter while using AlphaSmart 3000 and the solutions to these common problems.</p>

<p>When a file is transferred to the Macintosh, some of the characters do not show up or appear not to have transferred.</p>

<p>• If a USB cable is being used, verify that the AlphaSmart 3000 is run-ning AlphaWord v1.4 or higher. In the word processing program on the computer, turn off Auto Correct, Spelling, URL, etc. features.</p>

<p>• Disconnect the AlphaSmart 3000 from the Macintosh and check the file transfer speed by pressing option-x-S . Reset the AlphaSmart 3000 to a slower setting (speed 1 is the slowest).</p>

<p>• Try using a different word processing program. Some programs allow the AlphaSmart 3000 to transfer data faster than others.</p>

<p>• Adjust the keyboard control panel in the Macintosh system to a faster speed to maximize the file transfer speed.</p>

<p>My PC beeps when I send text to it.</p>

<p>• Make sure you have a word processor file open on the PC.</p>

<p>• Try changing to a lower send speed by disconnecting the AlphaSmart 3000 and pressing option-x-S .</p>

<p>Nothing appears on the AlphaSmart 3000 screen when I turn it on.</p>

<p>• Check your batteries. Plug your AlphaSmart 3000 into the AC adapter—if it turns on, your batteries are discharged or have been 60 Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions</p>

<p>improperly inserted. Make sure the batteries are oriented as indicated in the battery cavity.</p>

<p>• If the screen is blank except for a flashing cursor in the upper left corner of the screen, then you are simply in an empty file. Start typing and characters should appear on your screen.</p>

<p>When I attach my AlphaSmart 3000 to my computer, I can’t send any data and my AlphaSmart 3000 screen shows my file instead of the “Attached to…” message.</p>

<p>• Check the cable connections—one may be loose.</p>

<p>• If using a PC Y cable or Mac Y cable, check the computer ends of the cable for bent or broken pins.</p>

<p>Note: Young users are more likely to bend these pins.</p>

<p>When I start up the AlphaSmart 3000, I see something other than the file that I expected.</p>

<p>• Make sure you are in the correct file. AlphaSmart 3000 sup-ports eight different files. To change files, press file 1 to go to file 1, file 2 to go to file 2, and so on.</p>

<p>I try to type in a file, but no characters show up.</p>

<p>• First, check the status of the Slow Keys settings</p>

<p>• If the file looks empty, press the clear file key to make sure the file is erased. Then try typing again. (Sometimes the file recov-ery command option-x-R gets hit by mistake, filling up the file so that you can’t type any more into it. See the Data Recovery section for more details.) AlphaSmart 3000 61</p>

<p>• If you can’t see the cursor on the screen, then your batteries may be too low. Check your batteries or plug in your AC adapter.</p>

<p>My file (or the end of my file) is filled with garbage.</p>

<p>• If you have no useful text in the file, just press the clear file key to erase the entire file.</p>

<p>• If you have some data you would like to save, go to where the gar-bage characters start and press x-backspace to delete from the cur-sor to the end of the file.</p>

<p>• Send the file, and then cancel the transfer when garbage shows up.</p>

<p>When I transfer text to my PC, the case of the characters is reversed; all the lowercase characters show up as uppercase, and the uppercase characters show up as lowercase.</p>

<p>• The caps lock key was probably pressed on the PC keyboard when the AlphaSmart 3000 was connected. The computer remembers that the caps lock is on and does the case reversal. To fix it, simply press the caps lock key once either on the normal PC keyboard or on the AlphaSmart 3000 when it is attached to the PC (when the AlphaSmart 3000 is attached to the PC, it functions as a normal keyboard). Before sending from the AlphaSmart 3000, it is often a good idea to try typing a few characters from the AlphaSmart 3000 keyboard to see if it transfers correctly to the PC screen. If not, press the AlphaSmart 3000 caps lock key once to fix it, and then type a few keys to verify that it is correct.</p>

<p>The previous contents of the Clipboard show up in my document instead of the AlphaSmart 3000 file.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Press x-Z twice, or 2. Press x-V or ctrl-V to paste the AlphaSmart 3000 file, or 3. Press the send key again on your AlphaSmart 3000. 62 Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions</li>
</ol>

<p>• Transferring files to MSWorks takes longer than other pro-grams like AppleWorks. This is a problem with MSWorks—all pastes take longer, regardless of whether it is TurboTransfer or the user doing the paste.</p>

<p>• If the Clipboard is empty when MSWord starts up—such as when you first start a Macintosh—all you will get is a “Beep” when you try to transfer from the AlphaSmart 3000. This hap-pens when the Paste command is disabled—a bug in how MSWord handles the Clipboard when it is empty. To solve this, copy something into the Clipboard before you launch MSWord. An easy fix is to go to the Scrapbook under the Apple menu and</p>

<p>copy (x-C or ctrl-C ) anything there. You can also try the transfer (nothing happens), quit out of MSWord, and then re-launch the application. The transfer will work.</p>

<p>Although a matter of some debate, there are studies that suggest the following may be responsible for certain physical injuries: Typing for extended periods, improper positioning of your body while using a computing device, poor work habits, and/or individual health problems. Physical injuries could include carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and tenosynovitis. The warning signs of these injuries often occur after some injury has been suffered. The following may be symptomatic of this type of physical injury:</p>

<p>• Lack of feeling in the area</p>

<p>• A hot, burning feeling inside the area</p>

<p>• Tingling</p>

<p>• Throbbing</p>

<p>• Stiffness and/or aching In particular, watch for these symptoms in the hands, wrists, arms or neck. These symptoms may not occur during your use of the AlphaSmart 3000, or occur during times when work has not been performed for some time. In the event that these symptoms occur or you experience any other physical difficulties (including pain, stiffness or aching) that you think may be related, you should contact your doctor promptly. Caution: Please note that there may be a risk of physical injury due to improper use of your AlphaSmart 3000. In order to help reduce this risk of physical injury, read and follow the instructions in this section. The remainder of this section provides further safety information and advice about setting up your workstation, using proper posture, and using proper work habits.</p>

<p>Work Environment</p>

<p>Several factors may affect your ability to work in a comfortable and productive environment. By following the recommendations described AlphaSmart 3000 71</p>

<p>below, it should help you achieve such an environment and minimize the risk of physical stress that may cause injury.</p>

<p>Positioning of the AlphaSmart 3000</p>

<p>The AlphaSmart 3000 should be located in front of you and at a comfortable distance so that your arms and hands are resting in a relaxed and ready position at your sides. Choose a work area that can accommodate your AlphaSmart 3000 and any additional materials.</p>

<p>Furniture and Posture</p>

<p>Adjust your workstation to be physically comfortable and to allow your body to work in a relaxed and efficient manner. If your table and/or chair is adjustable, adjust the height and angle so that your forearms and wrists are straight and parallel to the floor, and your feet are flat on the floor (use a footrest if necessary). The back of your chair should be adjusted to support your lower back while working. Position your chair to avoid undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near your knee and the backs of your lower legs. In working, you should use a comfortable, upright position. Try not to lean forward, backward, or to the side while working. Materials should be within reach and frequently needed materials should not be located in an area where a twisting motion is required.</p>

<p>Hand and Arm Position and Motion</p>

<p>In using your AlphaSmart 3000, you should keep a relaxed, comfortable position that follows the suggestions discussed in this section. While working, your elbows may lightly touch your sides, but should not exert pressure against your body. Your wrists should be in a comfortable, straight position. Try not to arch or bend your wrists while typing as this may place strain on your wrists. Rest your hands on a palm rest or on the table (if you do not have a palm rest). When typing, use a minimum degree of force and avoid hitting the keys with more force than necessary.</p>

<p>Lighting</p>

<p>Like your workstation and posture, your lighting should be adjusted to accommodate your use of the AlphaSmart 3000. Adjust the lighting sources, 72 AlphaSmart 3000 Maintenance and Safety Guidelines</p>

<p>shades, drapes, or blinds so that glare on the screen is minimal, while still allowing comfortable viewing of the materials around you. You should use several lighting sources to accommodate different tasks, such as overhead lighting for viewing your AlphaSmart 3000 and the overall workstation area, and more focused lighting for closer desktop tasks.</p>

<p>Vision Care</p>

<p>Vision care is important, particularly if you are working for extended periods of time. Your eyes may become irritated and fatigued. Resting your eyes at regular intervals and keeping your glasses, lenses, and display clean should reduce the strain on your eyes. Also, it is advisable to have regular eye check-ups by a vision care specialist.</p>

<p>Work Habits</p>

<p>General work habits are an important part of working in a comfortable, relaxed, and efficient manner. Take note of your work habits and positions during the day. Try not to work for extended periods of time on a single task. By shifting between several tasks you change the physical demands placed upon you. In changing tasks, adjust your posture somewhat to avoid extended strain on certain muscles. Try to take several breaks during the day to stretch and exercise.</p>

<p>Health Habits and Exercise</p>

<p>Your existing health conditions can affect your ability to work in a comfortable manner. Health conditions which may make it difficult to work and may place undue stress upon your body include: Diabetes, excessive weight, hypertension, smoking, stress, arthritis or other inflammatory disease, and conditions affecting hormone levels (including pregnancy and menopause). Each individual has a threshold level of physical stress that they can comfortable and efficiently work under without harm. However, it is important to keep track of your physical well-being and to avoid exceeding your threshold. If you have any of the above mentioned physical conditions, you should regularly and carefully keep track of how you feel as you work. AlphaSmart 3000 73 Radio and Television Interference</p>

<p>The following tables show the international and special characters supported by the AlphaSmart 3000, and the keystroke sequence required to generate each character. Key combinations separated by hyphens (ctrl-option-2) should be pressed in the sequence given and held down until the last key is pressed. Key combinations separated by a comma (option-E, A) should be pressed sequen-tially; in this example, press and hold the option key while pressing E, then release them both before pressing A. You will not see a character displayed after pressing the E, but the character that appears after pressing the A will be an accented lowercase A. (These key sequences that do not produce visible results themselves, but modify subsequent characters, are called dead-key sequences.)
