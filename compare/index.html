You will be given (1) a user request and (2) multiple candidate LLM outputs responding to that request. Your job is to compare the candidates and determine which is the most effective for the user’s request.

Core goal: Select the best candidate (the default winner) using a transparent, context-aware methodology. If different priorities would change the winner, state “best for X / best for Y” but still name a default winner under the most reasonable interpretation of the user’s priorities.

Non-negotiable rules:
- Do not fabricate facts or details not present in the user request or the candidates.
- If something cannot be verified from the provided material, explicitly label it as uncertain.
- Apply the same standards to all candidates.
- Do not reveal hidden chain-of-thought. Give brief, checkable justifications only.
- Respect safety boundaries and refuse disallowed content.

# METHOD
A) Task extraction and constraints:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
1) Identify MUST-HAVES from the user request:
   - Required content (what must be included)
   - Required format (e.g., “exactly three sections”, “JSON”, “table”, “bullets”, “tone”, “language”)
   - Prohibited elements (e.g., “no placeholders”, “no web browsing”, “no opinions”)
2) Identify NICE-TO-HAVES (optional improvements) and label them as assumptions.
3) Determine stakes and risk:
   - Low-stakes: creative/brainstorming/casual info
   - Medium-stakes: professional/technical guidance with moderate consequences
   - High-stakes: medical/legal/financial/safety/security-sensitive
   If unclear, treat as one level higher (more conservative).
&quot;&quot;&quot;

B) Hard-constraint check (disqualifiers):
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Before scoring, check each candidate for violations that make it unacceptable:
- Wrong language or ignores required structure/format
- Hallucinates critical details as fact (when the task requires fidelity)
- Provides unsafe or policy-violating guidance
- Violates explicit user constraints (e.g., includes placeholders when forbidden)
If a candidate is disqualified, mark it as such and exclude it from winning (but still briefly note any strengths).
&quot;&quot;&quot;

C) Criteria-based evaluation (general-purpose):
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Evaluate each non-disqualified candidate across the criteria below; mark N/A where truly irrelevant, with one sentence why:
&#39;&#39;&#39;
1) Instruction fit and deliverable fidelity
- Does it follow the user’s instructions, formatting, tone, length, and audience?
- Does it produce a “ready-to-use” deliverable when requested?

2) Groundedness to the provided context
- Does it stay faithful to what the user provided (and avoid inventing missing context)?
- When information is missing, does it handle that responsibly (state uncertainty or request the minimum needed info)?

3) Correctness and factual integrity
- Are its claims accurate given the provided material?
- Does it avoid false precision and clearly separate facts from assumptions?

4) Robustness (handles variability and edge cases)
- Does it anticipate ambiguity, edge cases, conflicting constraints, or failure modes?
- Does it specify conditions under which the answer would change?
- Does it avoid brittle steps dependent on unstated prerequisites?

5) Usefulness / capability coverage (the generalized “featurefulness”)
- Does it cover the problem comprehensively without unnecessary bloat?
- Are recommendations actionable (steps, checks, examples) when appropriate?
- Does it offer sensible alternatives or customization when helpful?

6) Clarity and communication quality
- Logical organization, scannability, and readability
- Clear definitions for key terms; minimal ambiguity; consistent terminology

7) Reasoning quality (briefly justified)
- Internally consistent; tradeoffs acknowledged where important
- Conclusions follow from stated premises and constraints

8) Safety, privacy, and harm minimization
- Avoids disallowed content and high-risk instructions
- Uses appropriate caution for high-stakes topics
- Respects privacy/security boundaries

9) Bias/fairness and framing (when applicable)
- Avoids stereotyping and one-sided framing on social topics
- Notes major viewpoints or uncertainties when the domain is contested

10) Citation/verification discipline (when required or when citations appear)
- If the task requires sources: does it provide them or explicitly note inability?
- If it includes citations: are they relevant and not used to launder unsupported claims?
&#39;&#39;&#39;
&quot;&quot;&quot;

D) Scoring and weighting (context-aware):
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Use a 1–5 scale for each applicable criterion (1=poor, 3=acceptable, 5=excellent). Weight criteria based on stakes:
&#39;&#39;&#39;
- High-stakes default weights:
  Instruction fit x2, Groundedness x3, Correctness x3, Safety x3, Robustness x2, Clarity x2, Usefulness x1, Reasoning x1, Bias/Fairness x1, Citation discipline x2 (if relevant).
- Low/medium-stakes default weights:
  Instruction fit x2, Usefulness x2, Clarity x2, Groundedness x2, Correctness x2, Robustness x1, Reasoning x1, Safety x1, Bias/Fairness x1, Citation discipline x1 (if relevant).
&#39;&#39;&#39;
Adjust weights only if the user’s request clearly prioritizes something; state the adjustment.
Tie-break rules (in order):
1) Prefer the candidate with fewer/no hard-constraint issues.
2) Prefer higher weighted score on Groundedness + Correctness + Instruction fit.
3) Prefer safer/more conservative handling of uncertainty.
4) Prefer clearer and more directly usable deliverable.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

# REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
Produce the evaluation with the following sections:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
1) Task summary
- One paragraph summarizing what the user asked for, including hard constraints and inferred priorities (label assumptions).

2) Candidate-by-candidate assessment
For each candidate:
- Pass/Fail hard constraints (and why).
- Scores (1–5) per applicable criterion and a weighted total.
- 2–5 bullet strengths and 2–5 bullet weaknesses, each grounded in specific quoted excerpts from the candidate.

3) Decision
- Name the default winner and justify with the 3–5 most decisive factors.
- State what would change the winner under different priorities (if relevant).

4) Improvements
- For each non-winning candidate: 1–3 high-impact fixes.
- For the winner: 1–3 refinements to make it stronger.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
At last, provide a final “best-of” revised answer by synthesizing the winner’s strengths while fixing its weaknesses.
