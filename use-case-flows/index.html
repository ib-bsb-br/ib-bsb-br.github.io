1. &lt;analysis&gt;: Enclose your reasoning in &lt;analysis&gt; tags, detailing how you arrived at the Main Flow, Exceptions, and Alternative Flows.  
2. Main Flow (Basic Path): Present a numbered list of steps, clearly identifying actor/system actions.  
3. Exceptions (Error Flows): Label these flows (e.g., E1, E2) and describe possible error scenarios and how the system/actor respond.  
4. Alternative Flows (Extensions): Label these flows (e.g., AF1) and depict how the scenario changes under alternative conditions.  
5. Insert the newly completed sections into the provided use case template, ensuring coherence, cohesion and consistency.  
6. Produce the entire updated use case, including both the user-provided data and your completed sections. Use extensive and precise language.

So, again, as an AI assistant, your task is to complete the missing sections: Main Flow (Basic Path), Exceptions (Error Flows), and Alternative Flows (Extensions). Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the provided information in the use case.
2. Complete the missing sections, ensuring holistic consistency with the given context.
3. Review your output for completeness, clarity, and alignment with standard use case documentation practices.
Wrap your analysis and planning process inside &lt;analysis&gt; tags. In your analysis:
a. Analyze the given information
b. List potential exceptions and alternative flows
c. Outline the main flow steps
For the Main Flow (Basic Path), provide a numbered list of steps, clearly indicating actor and system actions. For Exceptions (Error Flows) and Alternative Flows (Extensions), use labels (e.g., E1, AF1) and describe specific scenarios deviating from the main flow.
Ensure your completed sections are detailed, clear, and consistent with the rest of the use case. Maintain a coherent and cohesive output and use extensive language throughout.
After completing the missing sections, provide the entire updated use case, including both the user-provided information and your additions.
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;brief_description&gt;

&lt;/triggers&gt;
&lt;preconditions&gt;
- Customer is logged in.
- Items are in the shopping cart.

&lt;/postconditions&gt;
&lt;ideal_output&gt;
&lt;analysis&gt;
Problem Statement: Complete the missing sections of a use case for an online purchase system, including the Main Flow (Basic Path), Exceptions (Error Flows), and Alternative Flows (Extensions).
Background Information: The use case describes how a registered customer completes an online purchase, triggered by clicking &quot;Checkout&quot; in the shopping cart. The system must be operational, items must be in the cart, and the customer must be logged in. The use case assumes a functioning payment gateway and sufficient customer funds.
Gather Information:
- Review the provided sections of the use case.
- Consider common steps in online purchasing processes.
- Identify potential exceptions and alternative flows based on typical e-commerce scenarios.
Analyze the Information:
- The main flow should cover the entire process from checkout initiation to order confirmation.
- Exceptions should address common issues like payment failures or inventory problems.
- Alternative flows should cover variations like guest checkout or promo code application.
- All flows must align with the given preconditions, assumptions, and stakeholder interests.
Formulate a Hypothesis:
- The main flow will likely include steps for reviewing cart contents, entering shipping details, selecting payment method, processing payment, and confirming the order.
- Exceptions will probably involve payment issues and inventory problems.
- Alternative flows may include guest checkout and promotional code application.
Test the Hypothesis:
- Check if the proposed flows align with the given use case information.
- Ensure all stakeholder interests are addressed.
- Verify that the flows meet the special requirements (performance, security, usability, compliance).
Draw Conclusions:
Based on the analysis and hypothesis testing, we can now outline the main flow, exceptions, and alternative flows.
Reflect:
- Consider how this use case might need to be adapted for mobile users or international customers.
- Think about potential future enhancements like saved payment methods or integration with loyalty programs.
&lt;/analysis&gt;
**8. Main Flow (Basic Path):**
1. **Customer** clicks &quot;Checkout.&quot;
2. **System** displays the checkout page.
3. **Customer** confirms or enters shipping details.
4. **Customer** selects payment method and enters payment info.
5. **System** validates information and processes payment.
6. **System** displays confirmation with order details.
7. **System** sends confirmation email.
**11. Exceptions (Error Flows):**
- **E1: Payment Declined:**
- **System** notifies customer.
- **Customer** retries or uses different method.
- **Use Case** returns to payment step.
- **E2: Item Unavailable:**
- **System** alerts customer.
- **Customer** modifies cart.
- **Use Case** continues.
**12. Alternative Flows (Extensions):**
- **AF1: Guest Checkout:**
- **Customer** proceeds without login.
- **System** collects necessary details.
- **Use Case** continues to payment.
- **AF2: Apply Promo Code:**
- **Customer** enters promo code.
- **System** applies discount.
- **Use Case** continues with updated total.
&lt;/ideal_output&gt;
&lt;/example&gt;
Your final output should preserve the original sections, fill in the missing ones, and reflect a structured, step-by-step narrative.
